AB Purpose Currently, environmental and social concerns have made green innovation more popular among researchers and practitioners around the globe. Developed countries tend to focus more on this issue, compared to developing countries. However, the reality shows that small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are considered as high contributors to environmental pollution. This study is designed for, and conducted on, SMEs in a developing country, Pakistan. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the main determinants of green innovation adoption in SMEs in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach A data sample of 288 SMEs from five different sectors was collected and analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique. Findings The results of the study indicate that organizational and human resource factors, market and customer factors, and government support and technological factors have a positive and significant impact, whereas external partnership and cooperation, and rules and regulatory factors have an insignificant impact on green innovation adoption in SMEs in Pakistan. Originality/value The outcomes of the study have important implications for managers as well as for government policy makers regarding framing better policies to promote green practices in SMEs.

AB The aim of this paper is to evaluate the diffusion-adoption of accrual accounting among Sri Lankan local governments. The paper draws on the Diffusion of Innovation theory to explain the factors that assist or mitigate the adoption of accrual accounting as a new accounting practice. Finance managers, charged with the responsibility of adopting accrual accounting, were influenced by two major factors: a centralised knowledge-diffusion process educating these finance managers about its compatibility; and its observability in practice to understand the benefits of adoption. The paper contributes to the understanding of the diffusion of accounting innovation in developing countries and the role of key players such as professional associations within this process.

AB Urban cities in the sub-Saharan Africa have witnessed unprecedented transformation because of the proliferation of religious orders within the social landscape. From Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon to Uganda, religious practitioners are actively involved in the spatial transformation through the construction of sacred spaces or prayer camps. The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) typifies one of the several examples of African Pentecostal denominations with transnational status in 200 countries across the world with the hub of its international office situated at the Redemption Camp, Mowe, Nigeria. The sacralisation of forest areas spanning 1600 ha of land has redefined religious institutions such as RCCG as perhaps one of the largest owners of private estate in Nigeria. However, there seems to be an intentional replication of the Redemption Camp, Mowe across Nigeria as well as across the Atlantic as part of the RCCG missionary enterprise. This study aims to utilise the ethnography of the Redemption Camps in Nigeria and Floyd, Texas, United States. The theoretical framework of social worlds is employed to examine the dynamics of religious creativity, innovations, contextual challenges of place-making involved in creating Redemption Camps across borders by the leadership of RCCG through the appropriation of religious capital of its community of sentiments.

AB Although innovation studies in developing countries acknowledge the importance of resources for firm innovation, their emphasis tends to be on bottlenecks created by resource constraints and institutional weaknesses. We address this shortcoming by exploring the relationship among firm resources and formal and informal institutions leading to innovation in these settings. By adopting a crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis of firms in sub-Saharan Africa, we confirm the thesis that informal institutions substitute underdeveloped formal institutions and in combination with firm-level resources afford firm innovation. More importantly, we find that informal institutions also complement more developed formal institutions in the presence or absence of high levels of firm resources or accommodate them in the presence of high levels of firm resources to support firm innovation. Our findings point to multiple paths that firms can take to be innovative that best fit their existing institutional context.

AB Responding to a number of longstanding challenges such as poverty, wide-ranging inequalities, environmental problems, and migration, requires new and creative responses that are often not provided by traditional governments. Social innovations can offer socio-ecological and economic solutions by introducing new practices that reduce social inequalities, disproportionate resource use and foster sustainable development. Understanding the role of social innovations is especially complicated in unstable institutional environments, e.g. in developing countries and countries in transition. This paper analyses nine social innovations in rural areas in Serbia, based on in-depth interviews and document analysis. This analysis reveals factors that facilitate or constrain social innovations whilst simultaneously identifying related formal and informal institutional voids, for example, poor law enforcement, a lack of adequate infrastructure, lack of trust, as well as norms and values that bolster patriarchal systems. The results that emerged from this research show that social innovations are operating in spite of these challenges and are facilitating improvements in a number of the aforementioned challenging areas. Some innovators engage in social entrepreneurship activities because of subsistence-oriented goals, while others follow idealistic or life-style oriented goals, thus creating new social values. Moving beyond these observations, this paper also identifies means to overcome institutional voids, such as creation of context-specific organisational structures, improved legal frameworks, and innovative financial mechanisms.

TI Training engineers for innovation: Pedagogical initiatives for new
   challenges
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The injunction to innovate which has permeated our societies in the last few decades has had a significant impact on engineers and their training. The idea of progress has since taken a back seat to the quest for innovation which saves time, space and reduces aims to short term performance objectives. However, marked by the technologism and productivism of the 20th century, the idea of innovation has also absorbed the new principles of sustainability and responsibility which have imposed themselves upon engineering research and activities in a henceforth internationalised world. It is within this context that engineer training institutions have sought to counter the injunctions to innovation and the stresses and strains that they produce. Based on three studies carried out in Europe and in several developing countries in North Africa and South East Asia, this article examines the curricula the institutions have implemented in order to observe current trends in innovation training initiatives in relation to locally-perceived expectations and requirements. We have observed that technologism and productivism, which are still very present in the principles which guide European engineer training, are in competition with the principles of low-cost engineering which satisfies user requirements and respects environmental constraints. As for the pedagogical initiatives, the phenomena of standardisation and commodification of higher education have led to the development of active learning (projects, problem-based learning, fablabs, etc.). However, studies demonstrate that pedagogical orientation depends on how innovation is conceptualised and varies according to the scale of the educational institutions. A closer examination of the concepts of innovation reveals the epistemological issues concerning the way the engineering problems have been constructed.

AB This study demonstrates how social innovation may engender development as well as peace in deep-rooted poverty and conflict regions in the Niger Delta context. By means of a qualitative study involving oil producing communities in the Niger Delta, this study identifies the dynamics, relevant actors and factors that foster social innovation, creating particular socio-economic outcomes, and contributes to the role of institutions in this context. Our findings suggest that active stakeholders' engagement, facilitation and contributions from key actors significantly influences the quality of economic and social outcomes, but not necessarily environmental outcomes. This allows us to advance the theory on social innovation by analyzing the mechanisms through which social intervention processes may alter the lives of ordinary community members in areas where social and economic interventions are seriously required.

AB This paper examines the energy efficiency performance of a sample of 71 developed and developing countries between 1990 and 2014. In most current energy literature, the transition to green technology is seen as a sustainable way to achieve a low-carbon or carbon-free environment. Bearing this in mind, we argue further that adopting green technology needs a strong backing and funding of reliable government institutions to shift the country's paradigm. Considering this issue, we adopt the parametric stochastic frontier approach built on the shepherd distance function to evaluate the effects of both governmental institutions and green technologies on energy efficiency. We find evidence of a significant positive influence of both green innovation and institutional quality on energy efficiency enhancement having controlled for some variables. Regarding energy efficiency levels of the individual countries- USA, Japan, Germany and Australia lead the chart while Belize, Panama, Singapore, Malta, Sierra Leone, Iceland, Jamaica, Bahrain and Ghana are the least energy efficient countries. Policy implications are further discussed.

AB Rural off grid electrification systems powered by renewable energy have become popular in the Global South. Unfortunately, many microgrids have experienced trouble during their first years of operation, leading to premature system deterioration. In this paper we trace these problems to institutional issues associated with goal displacement in implementing organizations and, relatedly, ineffective programme upscaling, which have remained under-researched in the rural renewable energy literature thus far. Using literature about implementation of large infrastructure projects, political economy of policy making, and replication of innovations as our conceptual lens, we examine a government-initiated microgrid programme in Indonesia. Early project failure was found to be linked to a one-sided policy focus on expanding the number of installed systems, instead of ensuring service quality. This focus is driven by political campaign strategies in which microgrid technologies are used as instruments for political legitimation, and pressure from aid donors to achieve early quantifiable results. It leads higher governmental echelons to care about reaching pre-set installation targets rather than ensuring that lower-level governments face incentives to focus on maintenance and repair. The focus on quantitative expansion also explains a lack of incentives or pressures to address a persistent lack of clarity about responsibilities of each government level, local communities, consultants, and contractors. Similar patterns can be noted in other countries, suggesting the findings have broader relevance for understanding key determinants of microgrid unsustainability in the Global South. To improve governance, pressure needs to be brought on the government by the general public, academia, NGOs and the press through increased public exposure of early system deterioration. These actions should be grounded in research that seeks to understand the complex causes of the problem, considering the whole scope of interlinked incentives and policies, before trying to tackle it.

AB Weak housing creditor protection, accentuated by weak landed property rights and underdeveloped credit information systems constitute major constraints to housing finance development in many developing countries. Improving housing creditor protection require further institutional development and financial innovation. As a trigger of financial innovation, regulation has spawned pension reforms leading to the global shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pension schemes, which has created new opportunities to improve housing creditor protection and thus engender housing finance innovations. This paper considers how pension assets-accumulated benefits and associated personal, employment and contribution information-has provided a basis for collateralized lending and an additional avenue for credit information system development. The paper proposes a pension asset-backed creditor protection model that utilizes defined contribution pension assets to improve housing credit allocation, and thus, housing finance development. Pension assets represent alternative or complementary collateral assets for securing a housing credit (mortgage). And as depositories of information, the information content of pension assets and institutions could also be used alternatively and complementarily to assess the capacity, character and contribution (equity) of potential borrowers in the credit underwriting process. Future applied research may consider how the proposed model could be integrated in existing credit underwriting systems and the operational challenges that could emerge.

AB While extant research has examined the separate influences of dynamic capabilities and institutions on international performance, their interactive role has received limited attention. Therefore, we examine the role of host-country institutional conditions in the relationships between emerging-market firms' (EMFs) innovation related dynamic capabilities and their international performance. We use multi-source secondary data and primary data from multiple informants from 254 Turkish international firms to test our framework. The study finds that the linkages between three innovation-related dynamic capabilities (innovativeness, supply-chain agility, and adaptability) and international performance are positively and negatively moderated by institutional development and institutional distance, but that their influences are opposite. These influences demonstrate that host-country institutional conditions shape the link between dynamic capabilities and EMFs' international performance in a multifaceted and paradoxical fashion.

AB The Bottom of Pyramid (BOP) market in developing countries represents an enormous market opportunity. Serving the BOP segment, however, incurs significant risks and costs because BOP consumers are deprived of income and literacy. It remains unclear whether or not serving this market segment would benefit firm performance. Based on related literature, we propose a new construct BOP orientation, and examine its impact on firm performance and an operating mechanism of such effect the mediating role of bricolage innovation strategy that emphasizes recombination of existing resources to solve the unique problems faced by BOP consumers. Drawing on the strategy tripod view, we also investigate the contingency effects of both institutional and industry environments in an emerging economy. We collected survey data to test the conceptual framework from 238 firms in China, the world's second largest BOP market. The results support a positive relationship between BOP orientation and firm performance and confirm that the performance impact of BOP orientation is channeled through bricolage innovation strategy. Further, we find that the effect of BOP orientation is contingent on both the institutional factors and the industry conditions. Specifically, government support strengthens while legal inefficiency weakens this effect; competitive intensity strengthens the effect, while technological uncertainty has no moderating role on this relationship. Contributions to extant literature and useful guidelines for firms of our research are discussed.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship among firm characteristics, innovation, financial resilience and survival of financial institutions in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach This paper employs a cross-sectional research design, and responses from 143 officers of 40 financial institutions are analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The authors used ordinary least squares regression in testing the hypotheses. Findings The authors find that firm characteristics of size, age, innovation and financial resilience have a predictive force on survival of public interest firms such as financial institutions. Research limitations/implications - The implication drawn here is that a combination of firm characteristics, firm innovation and financial resilience explains a significant contribution in the survival chances of financial institutions. However, as much as firm characteristics and financial resilience are significant, innovation explains more of the variances in financial institutions' going concern appropriateness. Originality/value This paper adds to the limited financial institutions literature and provides the first empirical evidence of the efficacy of innovation and financial resilience on financial institutions survival. The auditing profession could consider more seriously the innovation activities and financial resilience of financial institutions in their test for the going concern assumption of such firms.

AB This study estimates the relationship of institutional (judicial and political) and monetary (petty and grand) dimensions of corruption with six different types of innovations. Using cross country firm level data from World Bank Enterprise Survey for 16 developing and emerging economies, the study reveals that, in most of the cases, monetary dimensions of corruption grease the wheels of the innovations involving interactions with public offices and have an insignificant or negative association in opposite cases. Results show that corruption is disproportionately associated with the innovative activities of firms operating in different industrial groups devised as per Castellacci (Research Policy, 37(6), 978-994, 2008). Interestingly, both monetary dimensions of corruption are positively correlated with major innovation indicators in SMEs. Large firms are more the victims of the monetary corruption. Furthermore, innovation in the services sector is more harmed by petty corruption than is innovation in the manufacturing sector. Services firms seem to be taking advantage of grand corruption. Judicial corruption is found to be positively associated with most of the innovation indicators, highlighting the loopholes in the judicial system. Moreover, political corruption benefits both SMEs and large firms in most of their innovative activities. In the end, the study provides important policy insights from the analysis.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the use of Koha integrated library system by higher education institutions in Malawi. Design/methodology/approach The study made use of the diffusion of innovation theory as an anchoring model. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire that was administered to library managers of higher education institutions registered with the National Council for Higher Education in Malawi. The data collected were analyzed using SPPS version 21 to generate descriptive statistics. Findings The findings revealed that 84.2 per cent of libraries in higher education institutions in Malawi are automated, and 81.3 per cent of them are using Koha ILS and the rest were using proprietary and other open source software. Cost and technical aspects have been discovered to be the primary factors that have assisted in the rapid diffusion of Koha. The study also exposed some factors that negatively impacted the use of Koha in the adopting institutions. The main ones included lack of information and communication technology infrastructure, unreliable Internet connectivity and limited finances. Originality/value Previously, some small-scale case studies have been performed to examine implementation of Koha in some higher education institutions in Malawi. However, this is the first large-scale attempt to investigate use of Koha among higher education institutions in the country. Findings that have shown that Koha can be installed easily and used at minimal cost could assist in its rapid adoption in the higher education institutions, a majority of whom face a myriad of financial challenges.

AB The issue of poverty is generating growing interest in entrepreneurship research. Entrepreneurship is seen as a way to alleviate poverty, particularly in developing countries. Developed countries also face problems of poverty and consider entrepreneurship as a way to address this issue. However, little is known about innovation and entrepreneurship in the context of poverty. What conditions lead poor entrepreneurs to innovate? The present study attempts to answer this question using a multilevel approach (individual, organizational, and environmental characteristics). The theoretically derived model is tested using a dataset of 3373 entrepreneurs living in poverty in a developed country, France. Our results show that human capital, opportunity motivation, and financial resources favor innovation. However, individuals with necessity motivation and previous experience in the same industry are less likely to innovate. In addition, being in a less competitive environment, public financial aid and privileged relationships with suppliers are linked to a higher probability of innovation by poor entrepreneurs. The implications of these results are useful for designing appropriate programs to stimulate innovation and support poor entrepreneurs.

AB The crucial need for land ownership security to structurally transform the agricultural sector motivated Burkina Faso authorities to run a land reform programme in 2009, allowing producers to acquire formal land property rights. Our study aims to highlight how this institutional innovation may affect rural people?s livelihoods. In a first step, the paper uses an econometric approach to identify the effects of land property rights on producers? decision to adopt soil fertility management technologies. In a second step, it shows how the new law is affecting both vulnerable groups? access to land and the vulnerability of rural people by undertaking investigations on issues surrounding the implementation of the new law. The results show in the first step that unlike customary land rights, formal land rights lead to more technology adoption, implying that the new law may improve rural people?s livelihoods. However, this evidence mismatches the results in the second step which show a negative effect of the new land law implementation on rural people?s livelihoods. The paper concludes that whether or not formal land rights are needed in enhancing technology adoption, the new land law is likely to worsen rural people?s situation. Additional measures have to be undertaken to improve rural people?s livelihoods.

AB This study examines the impact of intellectual property rights (IPRs) on foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, using macro data over a panel of 39 middle- and low-income countries as classified by the World Bank. Empirical assessment was made in order to provide a clear and data-based explanation for this controversial issue. The analysis of the IPR/FDI nexus was carried out over the period 1990?2009 using GLS fixed effect (FE) and the two stages least square (IV2SLS) panel data estimation. Our empirical results show that the IPR has no statistically significant impact on FDI inflows in the sampled group, even when controlled for endogeneity. They also demonstrate that the FDI toward the developing countries is not affected by their institutional IPR's reforms. However, other variables, such as the economic freedom index, the market size and the level of human capital, are crucial in explaining foreign investments. These results are of particular interests to policymakers as they help identify the main factors contributing to the creation of an attractive and sound environment for FDI that can ensure sustainable economic growth.

ID INNOVATION
AB The reform of agricultural extension institutions in developing countries has in the past decade seen the implementation of many donor-supported farmer-to-farmer extension (F2FE) programs that are participatory and client-oriented. Their effectiveness in disseminating agricultural information is widely documented. However, most of these F2FE approaches only survive as long as funding support continues. Scant information exists on what can make externally initiated F2FE approaches sustainable. Drawing on lessons from a F2FE program known as the volunteer farmer-trainer (VFT) approach in an externally funded project in Kenya, this paper examines what makes such programs sustainable. The findings are based on the experiences of four dairy producer organizations (POs) that, three years after the end of project support, still had strong VFT programs. The paper highlights the importance of four drivers of sustainability: local institutional support, social capital, technical backstopping and motivation of farmer trainers to work voluntarily. Strong POs and farmer groups, coupled with the existence of an informal, multi-institutional network that supported the creation of knowledge and learning processes were key components contributing to the sustainability of the VFT program.

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

ID FARMERS
AB Agriculture Innovation System (AIS) thinking and approaches are largely perceived as a sine-qua-non for the design and implementation of effective and sustainable agriculture development programmes. AIS has gained popularity in the agriculture innovation literature and has been embedded in policy documents of agriculture sector institutions in many countries. However, there is much less evidence of AIS thinking influencing the behaviours of research and extension institutions and staff `on the ground'. An important research gap is the need to better understand the attitudes and beliefs of extension and research professionals regarding AIS and that drive behaviours. Sierra Leone, like most developing countries, has embraced the use of AIS (at least in theory) as evident in policy documents of government institutions - the leading innovation system actors in the country. This study uses the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to assess the cognitive foundation of agricultural research scientists and extension professionals' intention to use the AIS approach related to rice innovation (the country's staple food crop). Results show there are significant differences in intention which relate to organisation affiliation, age, and gender. Moreover, those with a high intention to use the AIS approach have significantly stronger beliefs associated with the benefits of AIS including its ease of use and the positive effects it is likely to have on smallholder farmers' food security and ability to innovate. Those with a high intention to use the AIS approach also perceive stronger social pressure from key social referents such as colleagues, employers and supervisors; suggesting that policies and an organisation's vision have a significant bearing. Furthermore, the findings suggest that impediments to the use of AIS relate to lack of finance and knowledge. Unpacking these beliefs allows possible entry points to be identified which can enhance the functioning of existing AISs and newly formed ones. The findings and framework presented are useful for many developing countries where AIS approaches are being tested.

AB Using the Indian medical device sector as a case study, this research examines the evolution of regulatory frameworks by analysing the conditions and processes through which regulatory environments for a technology-based industry come about. It also attempts to unpack the complex relationships between industrial capabilities in healthcare technology and human health, and the role of regulation in facilitating more inclusive healthcare and development in emerging countries. In doing so, the paper explains the ways in which an absence of collective action can severely inhibit the development of appropriate technological regulation and industry growth, particularly in the context of developing countries. It shows that contestation, conflict and coalitions as a key mechanism through which different stakeholders influence, enable and/or disable institutional change. These findings have significant implications for other developing countries which are struggling with the development of healthcare technology regulatory policy that is appropriate to local societal context and needs.

AB The provision of basic services suffers from a multitude of sustainability challenges in many cities of low-income countries. Sanitation provision faces particular challenges in the form of environmental contamination, high costs, and large inequalities among urban residents. In recent years an increasing number of innovations in on-site systems have been developed, which have not yet evolved into fully functional alternatives to the existing regimes. We study three prominent recent on-site sanitation initiatives in informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya that aimed at developing entire "sanitation value chains", which we conceptualize as an emerging Technological Innovation System (TIS). The analysis leads us to propose alternative governance modes for the TIS to overcome system failures such as capability, coordination and institutional barriers. Conceptually, the paper extends conventional TIS analyses towards entire value chains, enabling a wide range of transition processes to be addressed beyond informal settlements and low-income countries.

AB This paper explores the relationship between firm-level innovation and external finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Our sample consists of 13,430 firms from Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries. A propensity score matching approach reports a positive relationship between formal finance and product and process innovation, which is greater for early-stage SMEs than for mature counterparts. However, informal finance has more significant impact on mature firms' product innovation. Our empirical evidence highlights policy implications for countries desiring to enhance the innovation of their SMEs by improving the external finance of these SMEs.

AB Corruption as a non-market strategy for firms has gained increasing attention in the field of strategy management. However, the effect of corruption on innovation is unclear, especially in the context of transition economies. Using institutional theory, we examine the relationship between corruption and new product innovation and identify the contextual conditions of the relationship. Using the World Bank Enterprise Survey data from China, our empirical results show that corruption has a positive effect on firms' new product innovation. Moreover, we find that policy instability and competitive threats from the informal sector positively moderate the relationship between corruption and new product innovation. Using post hoc analysis, we find that the potentially positive effect of corruption on new product innovation is the consequence of inherent institutional weaknesses in transition economies; as the level of institutional development increases, the effect of corruption on firms' new product innovation will gradually decrease. Overall, our findings provide new insights into understanding corrupt behaviors in transition economies and present managerial implications for firms' ethical dilemmas in a transition economy context. We argue that the key to overcoming these ethical dilemmas lies in promoting pro-market institutional reform to reduce the potential benefits of corruption.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the factors that act as innovation obstacles in precision agriculture (PA) technologies in Argentina, one of the world leading exporters of cereals and oilseeds. The focus of this study is on the supply side, i.e. the factors that are perceived by PA firms as obstacles for the expansion of their market. Design/methodology/approach Based on a survey to 67 firms that develop PA technologies in Argentina, this study examines the impact of different types of obstacles on firms' growth and innovation activities. This analysis is complemented with the results that emerge from a series of interviews with different stakeholders (such as firms' managers, policymakers and experts). Findings In this study, it was determined that market and cost factors negatively affect firms' growth, while institutional obstacles reduce the amount of innovation efforts. In turn, knowledge barriers positively impact on the relevance firms assigned to R&D activities. This study helps identify different strategies that firms have put in place to overcome the barriers they face. Finally, policy implications of the results are discussed. Originality/value PA technologies may contribute to greening agricultural production and offer an opportunity for the emergence of domestic suppliers of innovative equipment and services based on the use of data science, artificial intelligence and Internet of Things. To the bets of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that explores the obstacles that prevent growth and impact on innovation activities of PA firms. The insights from this study are valuable for both researchers and policymakers aiming to foster emergence of high-tech clusters in developing countries.

AB The purpose of this paper is, to propose a methodology for the comparison and ranking of Entrepreneurial Ecosystems (EEs) in order to offer the decision maker a straightforward way of assessing the competitiveness of national economies. EEs are a coordinated set of individual and institutional agents, on the national level, aimed to pursue economic development through the discovery and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities. Among the various approaches found in EE research, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor consortium evaluates the national economic development of more than 100 countries, concerning both individual and contextual factors. Entrepreneurship Framework Conditions of national EEs are rated on an annual basis by groups of domain experts on a number of predefined criteria. These ratings describe the various facets of the EEs, exposing strengths and weaknesses of the contextual environment, offering a snapshot of the competitiveness conditions of the national economy. However, comparative studies examining the relative performance of each EE, are needed in order to communicate useful information and help stakeholders make insightful decisions and design policy. The ranking of EEs as different alternatives based on multiple criteria is a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. The relative importance of each criterion is defined either by experts or by statistical methods. The selection of criteria weights is usually a cumbersome procedure. The utilization of non-weighted or equal weight methods, eliminates the need for definition of weights, it has less computational overhead and can produce distinct and objective rankings of the alternatives. The Greek EE is taken as a working example, and it is compared with a number of developed and developing countries, as alternatives. The consistence of the ranking results produced by the method proposed is compared with the evaluations of other EE metrics and the results of other well accepted MCDM methods. The application of the method produced a distinct ranking for each alternative EE. The Greek EE ranked below average among the countries of the comparison group, implying that it is less conducive for entrepreneurship development, although it is categorized among the most developed Innovation Driven economies. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are thoroughly discussed offering useful conclusions.

AB Connecting science with policy has always been challenging for both scientists and policymakers. In Ghana, Mali and Senegal, multi-stakeholder national science-policy dialogue platforms on climate-smart agriculture (CSA) were setup to use scientific evidence to create awareness of climate change impacts on agriculture and advocate for the mainstreaming of climate change and CSA into agricultural development plans. Based on the platforms' operations and achievements, we used semi-structured questionnaire interviews and reviewed technical reports produced by the platforms to analyse how their modes of operation and achievements improve understanding of the science-policy interfaces between agricultural and climate change decision making. Results showed that these platforms constitute an innovative approach to effectively engaging decision-makers and sustainably mainstreaming climate change into development plans. Effective science-policy interaction requires: (a) institutionalizing dialogue platforms by embedding them within national institutions, which improves their credibility, relevance and legitimacy among policymakers; (b) two-way communication, which contributes substantially to the co-development of solutions that address climate change vulnerabilities and impacts; and (c) relevant communication products and packaging of evidence that aligns with country priorities, which facilitates its uptake in policy-making processes. We conclude with a framework of sustainable operation for such platforms based on lessons learnt in the three countries.

AB This paper examines the concept of authentic innovation and the development of the animation industry in Malaysia. Authenticity is a concept that has been investigated from philosophical and institutional perspectives in the quest to explain the role of self-fulfillment and decision-making. It links with systems thinking because authenticity as a strategy requires a holistic approach since it is based upon values that influence action. The desire for authenticity can create expression outside the norms and produce innovation. We present interpretations of authenticity, explain the concept of authentic innovation and relate this to three case studies of Malaysian animation studios. We found that cultural authenticity contributed to the uniqueness of the product and was a significant factor in the success of the animations in South East Asia. Challenges for maintaining authentic innovation arise primarily from economic pressure.

AB The present study intends to analyze how the degree of severity of environmental regulations and the international competitiveness of the countries affects the efforts in Green Innovation (GI) of companies of the industrial sector of Developed Countries (MEDC) and developing countries (LEDC). The survey sample consisted of 186 industrial companies, which are listed in the Financial Times' top 500 companies by market value in 2015, of which 114 were MEDC and 72 were LEDC. For the analysis, we used Structural Equation Modeling to verify the relationship between the variables. The main results were, among the antecedents of the green innovation analyzed, the rigor of the environmental regulations of the countries and the size of the companies had a statistically significant positive impact of the industrial enterprises of the MEDC and LEDC only in the IV2 construct, composed of the variables Global Compact and environmental investments. The competitiveness of the countries did not have a positive influence on the GI effort of the companies, and the Degree of Internationalization of companies has not had a significant effect on any of the GI constructs. Moreover, the results also showed that the relationship between environmental regulation and GI is moderated positively by the size of the companies and moderated negatively by the degree of internationalization, and the relation between the competitiveness of the countries and GI is negatively moderated by the size of the companies and moderated positively by its degree of internationalization. Although there is a prevailing view that environmental regulations provide a greater effort on the part of companies with green innovation, in this study it was verified that this relation can be positive or negative, and can also be modified by external factors such as size and the degree of internationalization of companies.

AB Purpose Corruption has been shown to discourage entrepreneurship in both developed and developing countries. However, it is less clear to what extent corruption affects the development of institutions' impact on entrepreneurial activity in the context of emerging economies, such as those in the post-communist countries. The purpose of this study is to use institutional economics as a conceptual framework to analyse the moderating effect of control of corruption (informal institution) on the relationship between formal institutions (such as the number of procedures, education and training [TEDU], access to finance and technology absorption) and entrepreneurial activity. Design/methodology/approach The study used panel data of 14 post-communist countries and different secondary databases from the years 2006-2016. Findings The main findings showed the importance of the institutional environment (formal and informal) on encouraging the rates of entrepreneurial activity. Overall, corruption showed that it behaves as a moderator between formal institutions and entrepreneurship. In particular, the evidence from this study showed that formal institutions, such as the number of procedures and TEDU, are more likely to encourage individual's choice to become an entrepreneur and start a new business activity in post-communist economies that have a perception of lower levels of corruption. Originality/value This study has several implications from both theoretical perspectives (advancing the application of institutional economics for the study of entrepreneurship) and from the practical point of view (providing insights for governmental policies interested in fostering higher levels of entrepreneurial activity).

AB Remittances to developing economies constitute one of their most important and consistent forms of capital inflow, but have long been limited by costs and risks associated with trans-border payments. New digital platforms lower these, with significant implications for financial inclusion and economic development. Constituting an important element of developing countries' engagement with international finance, remittances engender new opportunities for empowerment and vulnerability. This article analyzes recent developments in international remittances to developing countries through the lens of infrastructure. The infrastructural perspective reveals important junction points between diverse money transfer pathways and institutions, depicting their spatial configuration and relationality as well as their potential to affect power differentials, and allowing for a socially embedded view of digital disruption. Drawing on examples in Africa and Asia, we show that the new generation of remittance infrastructures are best understood as assemblages of multiple elements, conjoining monopolistic trunks that depend on local innovations to traverse the 'last mile' to reach end-users. The vibrancy and indispensability of local networks and innovation, along with competition among core platforms, allow for significant agency and economic opportunity even among communities beset by poverty.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report on the results of a study carried out to establish the contribution of board of directors' effectiveness, intellectual capital (IC) and managerial attitude to the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) in microfinance institutions (MFIs). Design/methodology/approach This study is cross-sectional and correlational. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey of 67 MFIs that are members of the Association of Microfinance Institutions of Uganda. The data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences. Findings Both board of director's effectiveness and IC positively and significantly contribute to the adoption of IFRSs. Managerial attitude is positively and significantly associated with the adoption of IFRSs, but its explanatory power is subsumed in IC. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the contribution of board of director's effectiveness, IC and managerial attitude to the adoption of IFRSs in MFIs using evidence from a developing African country like Uganda.

AB Purpose: Cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Its incidence is still increasing, particularly in developing countries. Recent progresses further strengthen the differences between low/middle and high-income countries. This situation calls for joint action to reduce inequities in cancer outcomes among the patients. The Association of Radiotherapy and Oncology of the Mediterranean Area (AROME) and the European School of Oncology (ESO), have initiated joint conferences devoted to access to innovations in oncology in the Mediterranean area. The heterogeneity of the economic, political and cultural situations of the different participating countries, offers the opportunity to develop consensus conference.
   Methods: Cancer prevention and treatment strategies were discussed according to existing international guidelines. The Scientific committee prepared 111 questions with an objective to prioritize the access to treatments and innovations in low/middle-income Mediterranean countries. The results from the votes of 65 oncology experts, coming from 16 countries and 33 institutions have been analysed and access priorities classified accordingly.
   Results: Ninety six percent of the proposed general recommendations concerning national health care strategies, oncology education, and treatment organization were considered to be high priorities. Regarding access to systemic treatments, 41% of the drugs without validated predictive markers and 53% of those with validated predictive markers were considered to be 1st level priority. Only 4 biological tests were considered to be 1st level priority to access to innovation.
   Conclusions: AROME-ESO consensus offers to cancer specialists from developing countries a basis for discussion with health authorities and payers on the prioritization of access to innovations in cancer care.

AB Scholars currently have a limited understanding of the role of R&D tax credit in developing countries. To help fill this gap, this article examines the allocation logic and innovative consequences of R&D tax credit in China. Using a panel data set of listed companies in China from 2010 to 2012, we show that the local institutional contexts, such as government transparency, market development, and industrial policies, promote the allocation of R&D tax credit. The fiscal capacity of local governments constrains the implementation of tax credit policy. Furthermore, this article estimates the causal effect of R&D tax credit on firm innovation. We find that R&D tax credit significantly increases firms' innovative input and output. The results are consistent and robust using various specifications. Yet the stimulation effect is heterogeneous across industries and scale. R&D tax credit only evidently promotes innovation in manufacturing firms and large firms.

AB Introduction Biannual mass azithromycin distribution to children aged 1-59 months has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality. Children under 28 days of age were not treated in studies evaluating mass azithromycin distribution for child mortality due to concerns related to infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). Here, we report the design of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of administration of a single dose of oral azithromycin during the neonatal period.
   Methods and analysis The Nouveaux-nes et Azithromycine: une Innovation dans le Traitement des Enfants (NAITRE) study is a double-masked randomised placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of azithromycin (20 mg/kg) for the prevention of child mortality. Newborns (n=21 712) aged 8-27 days weighing at least 2500 g are 1:1 randomised to a single, directly observed, oral dose of azithromycin or matching placebo. Participants are followed weekly for 3 weeks after treatment to screen for adverse events, including IHPS. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at the 6-month study visit.
   Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of California, San Francisco in San Francisco, USA (Protocol #18-25027) and the Comite National d'Ethique pour la Recherche in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso (Protocol #2018-10-123). The findings of this trial will be presented at local, regional and international meetings and published in open access peer-reviewed journals.

AB Cities have always been the predominant centres of political power, economic growth, educational and cultural advancement and technological innovation. However, rapid urbanization and growth of metropolitan cities, especially in developing countries, have resulted to various challenges that national and local governments and institutions fail to address completely. Against this background, small- and medium-sized cities are becoming the new growth nodes of the country. Batangas City in the Philippines is a medium-sized city located in the proximity of the Metro Manila region. This article provides an overview of the urbanization of Batangas City with special reference to its social, economic and urban characteristics along with its pressing challenges. The study highlights the current state of Batangas City with an emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on health, education and urban sustainability. Finally, the article attempts to conclude on whether the city is gearing towards a learning, healthy and sustainable Batangas City.

TI The Perceived Impact of Public Sector Corruption on Economic Performance

SO ECONOMIES

DT Article

ID GROWTH; GOVERNANCE; FIRMS
AB Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) contribute to the economic development of most developing countries. However, the economic performance of the MSMEs is often restricted by several obstacles. This paper reports on a study of the impacts of public sector corruption on employment growth in MSMEs, as perceived by their managers/owners. The data originated from a nationwide survey that involved MSMEs managers/owners in Papua New Guinea (PNG) that were selected by a stratified random sampling technic. The data was analyzed using a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression model. The results show that MSME managers/owners perceive that corruption in the public sector is generally linked to an increase in employment growth in their firms. Medium-size enterprises benefit most from corruption in the public sector, whereas small-size firms appear not to benefit. The findings indicate that other than corruption, there might be failures in the public institutions that are hampering the competitiveness, innovations and efficiency in MSMEs. Corrupt practices can precipitate the loss of revenue that would have accrued to the government from tax that could be used to provide facilities required by the public institutions. Corruption in the public institutions of developing countries such as PNG can be tackled by implementing strategies that promote zero-tolerance for corruption. These include promoting public awareness of the cost of corruption to the country's economy, improvement in the quality of governance, and expanding the capacity of government agencies for effective and efficient service delivery. Increasing the penalty for engaging in corrupt practices could also be considered, while people who engage in practices that discourage corruption should be rewarded. The findings contribute to a potential strategy that could be used to promote ease of doing business in a country by considering the obstacles that MSMEs face.

AB The drivers of eco-innovation (EI) have been the focus of much research in the past. Some of these drivers have been external to the firm, such as regulation, whereas others have been internal, including its resources and capabilities and its environmental strategy. However, the analysis of the impact of those drivers on EI has too often been carried out as if they were separated from each other. In reality, the EI drivers are likely to interact. This paper tries to cover this gap in the literature using a holistic and integrated approach. Survey data from 97 chemical firms were analyzed using partial least squares to determine the critical drivers of EI and their interconnections. Our results indicate that, in fact, the impact of some drivers might not be direct but is mediated by their influence on other drivers. This is the case with environmental collaboration, environmental knowledge, green skills, consumer pressure, and export behavior, which have an indirect effect on EI through their impact on environmental strategies. Therefore, our results suggest that environmental strategy is a central mediator and a powerful driver for the entire model.

AB Financial sector development plays a pivotal role in the process of economic growth and development through mobilization of savings and creating investment opportunities. Financial development also increases the level of technology by providing finance to entrepreneurs for technological innovations which leads to economic growth. Moreover, financial markets develop rapidly in those countries which have strong legal system to enforce property rights, support private contractual arrangement and protect the rights of investors that can support real economic activities. Therefore, the presence of good quality institutions strengthens financial development which leads to technological development and growth. This study investigates the impact of financial development, technology and institutions on economic growth of selected developing countries over the time span of 1996-2015. This study extends the Augmented Solow growth model by incorporating variables such as financial development, technology, institutions and their interaction terms in the model. Due to endogeneity problem, the empirical model used in the study is estimated by System Generalized Method of Moments (System-GMM). Empirical results show that financial development, technology and institutions have very strong effects on the economic growth developing countries. To attain a sustainable economic growth, developing countries should develop their institutions which are necessary for the effective functioning of financial markets that stimulate economic growth by providing finance to entrepreneurs for innovations in technological sectors.

SO INDIAN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW

AB Purpose
   The study aims to empirically investigate the trends and determinants of labour productivity of the two broad sectors -industry and services - and their components, namely, manufacturing and market services sectors, in the case of major developing and developed economies of Asia-Pacific over the period 1980-2014 and make a comparison thereof.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study uses econometric methodology of panel unit root tests, panel cointegration and group-mean full modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS).
   Findings
   The study finds that while capital deepening, government size, institutional quality, productivity of the other sector and financial openness affect productivity of all the sectors significantly, the impact of human capital and trade openness varies across sectors in the case of developing economies. Furthermore, the impact of technological progress becomes significant in the post-liberalization reforms period in the developing economies. The study further finds that capital deepening, human capital, government size, institutional quality, productivity of the other sector, government size and trade openness are significant determinants of productivity of all sectors of developed economies under consideration. However, the impact of technological progress is stronger for manufacturing sector than services and its components. Furthermore, while both equity and debt liabilities (as measures of financial openness) influence sectoral productivity of industry and manufacturing sectors positively and significantly in case of developed economies, only equity liabilities have a significant influence on the productivity of developing economies. This may indicate existence of more developed financial markets in the case of developed economies.
   Originality/value
   The study identifies important structural differences in determinants of productivity both across sectors and across developing and developed economies of Asia-Pacific.

AB While consumer and marketing research in developed markets is an established field, research on consumers in an Bottom of the Pyramid (BoP) setting is less established and mostly conceptual or qualitative. This paper examines the individual heterogeneity and the local context of BoP consumers with an empirical study on consumption of low cost bottled water on the Kenyan coast and the capitals of Uganda and Rwanda. The empirical analysis builds on existing research exploring consumer behavior, and it studies a database of 713 bottled water consumers in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. Consumers with a higher level of education were less likely to be late consumers. Additionally, early consumers were more likely to purchase due to a purposeful search for a bottled drinking water solution. Since we control for location specific effects we highlight the importance of supply driven consumption in the BoP market. Furthermore, the results suggest that the two water companies may not be reaching their targeted low-income consumers but rather middle class consumers. The research contributes to the larger BoP debate by presenting evidence that consumers in a BoP setting may purchase more on the basis of supply of a product rather than other socio-demographic factors such as income.

AB Purpose Although scholars have investigated how social entrepreneurs create and develop social enterprises in the penurious stable environment, how they are created in the penurious unstable environment has yet been overlooked. The purpose of this paper is to address this research gap by exploring how internally displaced individuals, despite the lack of resources, create and develop a social enterprise to serve the other displaced population in the war and conflict zones. Design/methodology/approach Underpinned by a biographical research design, in-depth interviews with internally displaced individuals who have created social enterprises in the war and conflict zones were undertaken. Three social entrepreneurs were chosen for this study from three different social enterprises that are created by internally displaced individuals to serve the other internally displaced people of three different countries, namely, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Syria. Findings The single and cross-case analysis found that internally displaced individuals deploy bricolage strategy, for example, reconfiguration of pre-existing resources and competencies (both internal and external), to start up a social venture in the war and conflict zones. They utilise pre-existing internal resources, mainly human capital, and external resources, through a frugal approach towards resources acquisitions. The authors also found that the displaced social entrepreneurs utilise resources of other displaced individuals, for example, networks, volunteers, local knowledge and financial supports mainly from older arrivals, and develop their own enterprise ecosystem within the host location to co-create and co-develop social enterprise and social values for all of them. Originality/value This study contributes to the limited literature and studies on social entrepreneurship, specifically, to the context of unstable penurious environment. It also contributes to the literature on bricolage by extending its application from penurious stable environment to the penurious unstable environment. By exploring what and how internal and external resources are utilised to create and develop a socially entrepreneurial venture in a war and conflict zones, this study has added value to the literature on not only bricolage but also entrepreneurship in war and conflict zones.

AB Mobilizing climate finance for climate change mitigation is a crucial part of meeting the well-below' 2 degrees C goal of the Paris Agreement. Climate finance refers to investments specifically in climate change mitigation and adaptation activities, which involve public finance and the leveraging of private finance. A large proportion of climate finance is Official Development Assistance (ODA) from OECD countries to ODA-eligible countries. The evidence shows that the largest proportion of climate finance for climate change mitigation has been channelled to the development of renewable energy, with a much smaller proportion flowing to other crucial forms of clean energy-related measures, such as demand-side management (DSM) (particularly sustainable cooling) and carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS). This forms the rationale and aim of this synthesis paper: to review the role of climate finance to develop clean energy beyond renewables. In doing so, the paper draws on practical policy and programme experiences of some donor countries, such as the UK, and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs). This paper argues that a greater amount of climate finance from OECD countries to ODA-eligible fossil fuel-intensive emerging economies and developing countries is required for sustainable cooling and CCUS, particularly in the form of technical assistance and clean energy innovation.

AB Under increased scrutiny by its funders, the CGIAR continues to search for ways of translating research excellence into innovation and developmental impact. Several approaches have been suggested that recognize the interactive nature of innovation. While these have been deemed useful, it is the deeper institutional change agenda that has been a bottleneck in the evolving ways of the CGIAR deploying science for impact. This article documents an example in the CGIAR where significant innovation appears to have taken place in research practice, and where the institutional setting of both the CGIAR center involved and its donors have adapted to accommodate this new approach. The case study presented is recent experiences at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) of developing and facilitating the adoption of Index-Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) in Kenya and Ethiopia. The approach of the IBLI program evolved as a form of research practice that expands the boundaries of legitimate research practices in the CGIAR: it maintained the essentials of international public goods, but also included activities engaging with innovation processes that led to tangible household impacts. While the development and use of this approach was not without its tensions both within ILRI and with donors funding the work, the approach proved highly successful and won acceptance and legitimacy. This suggests that organizations should encourage and support individual projects and teams to adapt, develop, and adopt different approaches in order to achieve impact. Accepting pluralistic narrative of success will be a critical part of this.

AB Technological innovations are important sources of competitive advantage when there is a balanced rate of adoption that helps organisations maintain or improve performance levels. This paper synthesises and builds on efforts to conceptualise the adoption and implementation of technologically induced customer services in developing countries. Its point of departure is recent advances in computer-mediated marketing environments (CMMEs). It assesses relationships between customer services and evolving technologies in the provision of services in the banking sector. Using phenomenological hermeneutics and a case study approach, we iteratively engaged with data that emerged to identify core values and community-based values. These facets were further developed into seven main issues (core values: quality, education and reach, and community-based values: efficiency, usability, control and security). The paper offers practical steps by which companies and institutions may counter these issues and the theoretical implications for wider considerations are discussed.

AB How does the introduction of tied labour or a saving product affect labour market decisions and wages in rural agricultural labour markets? We develop a theoretical model of labour tying that incorporates diminishing marginal returns to consumption and inequality (behindness) aversion in the context of a rural agricultural labour market with seasonally fluctuating demand for labour, and test model predictions using a framed field experiment (modified ultimatum game) in rural Uganda. Our main findings are that (1) wages fluctuate with productivity, (2) access to tied contracts decreases wages for casual labour and (3) access to a saving technology does not improve wages for tied labour. Consistent with model predictions and earlier theory, we empirically find that income for workers goes down (and income for landlords goes up) if an institutional innovation enables consumption smoothing by workers (tied contracts or a saving technology).

AB Objectives:ADVOS multi is a recirculating albumin-based dialysis device that supports kidney, liver and lung function by eliminating CO2, water-soluble and protein-bound substances. In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure.
   Objectives:Given the extent of bypass graft failure, the motivation behind this multidisciplinary project is to improve the patency of the current bypass grafts by developing a novel and optimised blood flow augmentation technique. Methods: One of the most significant contributions to the improvement of haemodynamics in grafts was based on a research which showed that the 'spiral flow' is a natural phenomenon in the whole arterial system and is induced by the twisting of the left ventricle during contraction and then accentuated upon entering the aortic arch. The benefit of this flow pattern lies in removing unfavourable haemodynamic environment such as turbulence, stagnation and oscillatory shear stress, which are believed to be the main causes of intimal hyperplasia at anastomotic configurations. Results:This multi-disciplinary engineering venture has resulted in a unique product which makes use of both non-planar helicity and an optimised internal ridge within the graft to achieve a significantly improved haemodynamic condition within the anastomosis (an anastomosis is a surgical connection between autologous/prosthetic grafts and veins/arteries inside the human body) Discussion:This truly multidisciplinary project has integrated fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology with cardiovascular surgery to develop a novel biomedical device, inspired by the nuclear engineering sector. The novel spiral-inducing bypass graft, nominated for this award, is the best example of how engineering techniques, tools and designs can lead to life-saving innovations that could potentially save the lives of thousands of people and save millions of pounds for the healthcare systems across the world. Such successful engineering stories are what would encourage the next generation of engineers to go beyond the traditional boundaries of engineering disciplines to make a difference.
   Objectives:The goal of this work was to study methods that will allow increase in spatial freedom of couplers orientation in inductive powering unit for implantable medical devices. An inductive energy transfer system is considered, therefore the freedom of relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving coils must be optimized. Methods:The design procedure of inductive powering unit (IPU) consists of two main steps: design of the power amplifier and optimization of an inductive link. To account for the patient specifics, such as tissue thickness near the implantation site, a number of different couplers were simulated using finite element modeling. Effect of coils geometrical parameters on mutual inductance and inductive link efficiency was examined. Class E power amplifier was chosen as a driver for the transmitting coil. Capacitors in the amplifier loading network were tuned to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). A patient's everyday activity, including walking and even breathing, leads to misalignment of the transmitting and receiving coils, and, as a result, detuning of the amplifier from ZVS and increased losses. Feedback schemes were studied to compensate the misalignments effect on the amplifier. Results:A self-oscillating IPU with class E amplifier was designed that provides stable output power about 0.5 W for the distance between the couplers in range 10-20 mm and the lateral distance up to 20 mm. The use of self-oscillating circuit in the transmitter increases spatial freedom of the transmitting and receiving coils corresponding to ZVS. Discussion: Inductive link geometrical parameters optimization and implementation of self-oscillating class E driver the IPU contributes to stable output power and efficiency of IPU. As a result, less intervention from the patient and physician is required, and patient quality of life is increased Precision medicine emerges from integration of a number of emerging technologies and the data they produce with modern data analytics. For precision diagnostics and for predicting drug responses new computational and in-vitro models are needed from gene regulation to cellular and organ functions. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) derived e.g., from patient blood cells provide means to produce most cell types and thus provide means to get patient specific in-vitro models. New technologies are needed to produce tissues from these cells and to assess the cell functions in-vitro. In addition, computational in-silico models can be used to augment our understanding of the diseases or drug effects. They also provide tools to translate the in-vitro findings to clinical settings and patient populations. We are in transition to turn our in-vitro cell culture models to body-on-chip platforms including environmental control and biophysical functional sensing. We have developed methods to assess the cellular functions based on electrophysiological sensing as well as 2D and 3D bioimaging. For example, we have developed imaging methods to assess functions of hIPSC cardiac cell with simultaneous assessment of electrophysiology such as Calcium and voltage transients as well as mechanobiology in vitro. Further, we have developed in-silico models of various cellular function including multi-cell-type neuronal networks and in-silico population models of the hIPSC cardiomyocytes. The later ones are providing us ionic machinery of hIPSC derived cardiomyocyte electrophysiology in various populations of patiets.
   We have shown that these computational models can represent pathological patient phenotype cells and populations of patients with specific mutations, e.g., long QT syndrome. We have also demonstrated the power of in-silico as possible pre-screening method for drug effects prior to in-vitro examinations. Moreover, our in-silico results highlight the need of careful consideration of use of HiPSC models before they can be turned from immature cell models to mature tissues in vitro. With integration of novel engineering expertise from multimodal sensing, imaging and computational modelling, we have shown their power on studying diseases and for pre-screening of compounds. Our results demonstrate the power of combined in-vitro and in-silco methods for future precision medicine.
   Objectives: We have developed in vivo tissue engineered autologous vascular grafts constructed in the subcutaneous of the recipient body. However, since the formation of the vascular grafts depends on the conditions of recipients including high risk or immature patients, immaturity in the fabricated tissues might be problematic for the severely diseased patients because of their suppressed regenerative activity. Therefore, possibility of the xenogeneic or the allogeneic implantation of the grafts should be evaluated. The objective of this study is to fabricate cardiovascular grafts using xenogeneic or allogeneic animals. Methods: Silicone rod molds were placed into subcutaneous pouches of beagle dogs, and after 4 weeks the implants with their surrounded connective tissues were harvested. Those were decellularized with detergents and stored at -20 degrees C for 1 week. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 2 mm) were xeno-transplanted to abdominal aorta of the rats. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 5 mm) were cut open and trimmed to elliptical sheets of 15 x 8 mm, they were allo-transplanted to carotid arteries of other beagle dogs as vascular patches. Results: Both xenogeneic vascular grafts and allogeneic patch grafts performed well after transplantation, and the luminal surfaces after resection were very smooth. Histological evaluation also showed host cells infiltration into the grafts. Discussion: Decellularized xenogeneic and allogeneic connective tissue membranes could be ideal vascular grafts.
   Objectives: This work aimed to print high-resolution, collagen-based, constructs via suspended 3D printing with load-bearing and compositions closer to native bone; for potential use as implant materials. Methods: Collagen type I (Col) and gelatin methacroylate (GelMA) blends were systematically investigated as bio-inks, probing their rheological properties and crosslinking efficiency for printing. An adapted 3D bioprinter (3DDiscovery, regenHU, Switzerland) based on an extrusion principle was used to print constructs. Calcification was investigated, in vitro, using a polymer-induced liquid precursor for the mineralization process. Results: Careful control over the formulation and processing resulted in refined construct properties such as: wall width (500um), lattice length (2cm) and shape (bone trabeculae). Once printed, the ability to cure the GelMA/Col blends was dependent on photo-polymerisation methodology, with enhanced curing and lower remaining soluble fractions (10% vs 40%) for visible light + Riboflavin/SPS in comparison to UV + Irgacure. Control over the construct structure allowed defined mineralisation, and subsequent material responses. Discussion: In recent years the development of 3D printing technologies has attempted to combat the growing need for bone repair solutions, although is limited by the number of bio-inks, and printable resolutions available. Suspended manufacture has sought to address this issue, using a fluid gel to support a secondary biologically relevant bio-ink whilst it undergoes a curing step, during or post-printing. To date, printing techniques have not been shown to provide fully resorbable and/or mechanically satisfactory bone implants. This research has shown promise as the first steps towards printing high resolution constructs with chemical compositions more closely matching that of natural bone. Further works involve deeper investigation of calcification and impact on implants mechanical properties and microstructure.
   Shifting from treating symptoms to curing chronic diseases by making the transformative promise of Advanced Therapies a reality for the benefit of patients and society and by making Europe a spearhead of Advanced Therapies in Science, Clinics and Biomedical Industry, that is the vision of the large-scale research initiative RESTORE - Health by Advanced Therapies. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and multi-morbidity due to demographic factors represents a high socio-economic burden for Europe. The direct health costs increased by 50% during the last decade and reached euro1.526bn in 2017, a staggering 9.6 % of Europe's GDP. As current therapies rarely cure, but merely fight symptoms, never-ending treatment is required, which means diminished quality-of-life, adverse effects and soaring cost for society. There is a high need to reach sustainable improvement for patients or even to cure them of chronic diseases - in other words, to disrupt the paradigm of "treating symptoms" with "restoring health". Advanced Therapies are the game changers that open up transforming therapeutic opportunities. For genetic diseases, immune diseases, cancer and tissue injury potential cures through Advanced Therapies exist - it is reality, not fiction. Some products are already on the market, mostly for rare diseases which means only a few thousand patients worldwide have benefitted from Advanced Therapies until now. At the advent of such a trailblazing change, obstacles and roadblocks abound. To make the disruptive promise of Advanced Therapies to cure chronic diseases a reality and to make Advanced Therapies accessible as standard-of-care for every European patient in need, RESTORE envisage to establish a sustainable pan-European ecosystem integrating transdisciplinary research, clinics, patients, and industry. Please join us for more details. RESTORE is funded by the EU for the preparatory phase of the large-scale research initiative (h2020, No 820292).
   Our main objective is to develop safe medical products for a minimally-invasive surgical intervention that fulfill all requirements by the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR). The secondary objective is to minimize the time to market by implementing standard conforming processes in a minimalistic way so they can be operated by only a handful of people. The twist in the story is that one of our products of our system will be individualized in the operating theater. While basically everybody is forced to operate in a "learning by doing" mode regarding MDR compliance, we do rely on external trainings provided by notified bodies and other sources like websites, webinars, and dedicated conferences to learn more about how to fulfil regulatory requirements. Additionally, we are partnering with our strategic investor (a manufacturer of class-III implantable active devices) to receive trainings and advice regarding regulatory affairs. However, it has to be stressed that one has to consider all parts of the MDR, especially the annexes and the applicable norms. Here we present our technical approach and our strategy on how we aim full MDR compliance. We established a completely digital workflow for all our documents, including cryptographic signatures, version history, reviews, mainly based on open source tools. This allows us to handle the document management very swiftly. We have one person dedicated to our quality management system. The risk management is integrated as a cross-cutting-concern into all the product development processes. The main challenge in the planning and founding phase of OtoJig GmbH was and still is to estimate what has to be done, which norms do apply, and how much effort (time and money) it is to perform the steps and create all the required documents. A difficulty is that contradicting statements between the MDR and other applicable norms are still under interpretation and public discussion.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to study the influence of person physiology and anatomy, which include postoperative edema, movement and breathing of a patient, on the results of designing of inductive powering unit (IPU) for VAD and to propose design recommendations. Methods: A characteristic feature of the IPU is the misalignment of the coils. The stability of the VAD power supply (especially with continuous powering) is very important. Therefore, it is necessary to design an IPU tolerant to coil misalignment. The procedure of geometrical optimization for increasing the stability of energy transfer of IPU was performed for 3 axial distances between coils d (8, 10, 12 mm), which is a typical misalignment with a postoperative edema. The lateral misalignment of the coils reached the value of the outer radius of the receiving coil (35 mm), which characterizes the patient movement or breathing. The operating frequency was taken 1 MHz, and the output power of the system was 10 W. The power drop was within 10%. The results were verified by numerical simulation in MATLAB and PSpice. Results: It was found that with a decrease of d from 12 to 10 and 8 mm, the optimal outer radius of the transmitting coil increases from 53.9 to 54.6 and 55.7 mm. Turn pitch in the transmitting coil increases from 4.9 to 5.2 and 5.3 mm. For a receiving coil, turns pitch is increasing from 3 to 3.2 and 3.6, respectively. For all cases of d in each coil there are 11 turns (except for d = 8 mm, where there are 10 turns in the receiving coil). It is recommended to design coils with a slightly larger coils turns pitch and the outer radius of the transmitting coil because of disappearance of postoperative edema. Discussion: In this work, the influence of person physiology and anatomy on the design of IPU for VAD was investigated, and recommendations for designing were given.
   Objectives: Membrane oxygenators are an indispensable part of critical care medicine. Though necessary to supply sufficient gas exchange, the high intrinsic surface introduced by the hollow fiber packing has serious side effects on blood platelet parameters. To reduce these side effects the membrane surface must be minimized and gas exchange improved. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can support oxygenator optimization and supplement experimental data by delivering a spatial and temporal resolution of the gas exchange. While current research mostly focusses on the gas transport in the blood flow, this work presents a fully resolved CFD approach including transmembrane transport as well as convective and diffusive blood gas transport on shell- and lumen-side of the hollow fibers. Results: CO2 transport in a packing segment of a prototype hollow fiber module was fully resolved and simulated utilizing an inhouse solver membraneFoam based on the open source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Simulation results show a CO2 partial pressure decline from 50 to 15 mmHg in the laminar boundary layer and an additional drop of 12 mmHg at the selective membrane surface. Boundary conditions for the gas transport simulations were computed by blood flow simulations of the whole module. Simulation results were compared to in vitro tests comprising measurements of CO2 exchange performance and blood side pressure drop of the prototype module. Discussion: Flow simulations predict the experimentally determined pressure drop of 68 mmHg at blood flow rates of 1280 mL/min accurately. The specific CO2 exchange rate of 220 mL STP/min/m2 is overpredicted due to the reduction of the whole packing to an idealized packing segment. Nevertheless, CFD allows for a structured optimization of membrane oxygenators as design changes can be efficiently investigated.
   Objectives: Anticoagulation therapy in LVAD patients is essential to reduce hemocompatibility related adverse events (HRAE). Phenprocoumon dose must be adapted and monitored by INR point-of-care-testing (POCT) in outpatients. The study aims to determine if the frequency of INR POCT in LVAD outpatients has an influence on the quality of anticoagulation therapy, HRAE and clinical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective, pseudo-randomized study included n=48 patients who received an LVAD implantation (HMII, HM3 and HVAD) between Jan. 2012 and Oct. 2016. Based on the frequency of weekly INR POCT, we compared a daily (n=36) and a 3x/week (n=12) group, specifically the 1-year anticoagulation quality (% of INR Tests in Range) as well as clinical outcomes, readmissions and HRAE using Kaplan-Meier curves. Readmission profiles and outcomes in three groups, based on the achieved quality of anticoagulation (% of INR Tests in Range) ranging from 0-60% (poor), 60-70% (acceptable), 70-100% (well controlled) were compared. Results: Daily and 3x/week groups were similar in demographic and pre-operative risk factors, INR target (2.0-3.0, p=0.27) and Aspirin daily doses (p=0.29). Freedom from any HRAE (38.9% vs. 25.0%, p=0.44), any readmission (72.2% vs. 75.0%, p=0.97) and 1-year survival (91.7% vs. 91.7%, p=0.98) were comparable in both groups. The % of INR Tests in Range was significantly higher with the daily self-assessments (73.5% vs. 68.4%, p=0.006). Freedom from any neurological event (91.7% vs. 75.0%, p=0.14) was n.s. higher in the daily POCT group. Well vs. poorly controlled INR POCT patients had a significant higher freedom from any neurological event (96.0 vs 69.2%, p=0.024) as well as hemorrhagic strokes (100% vs. 76.9%, p=0.011). Discussion: Well controlled anticoagulation of LVAD outpatients results in less neurological events including hemorrhagic stroke. Daily INR POCT and subsequent dose adjustment of vitamin-K antagonists result in a better quality of anticoagulation than 3x/week checks.
   Objectives: Spectroscopic method is widely used for non-invasive blood glucose (BG) measurement. Despite the progress in implementation of transmission NIR-spectroscopic method, applicable mostly for earlap measurements, research of non-transmission methods allows for the exapnsion of spectroscopy range of use. The aim of research is to estimate the penetration depth for 1600 nm radiation using reflection NIR-spectroscopy. Sufficiency of penetration depth on this wavelength would allow for the use of a mathematical model implemented in the transmission method. Methods: The developed experimental setup includes a semiconductor laser with wavelength of 1600 nm, two photodiodes, reflecting surface, control unit and power supply. For determining the position of optical elements a MATLAB program was developed, which calculated efficient detected radiation intensity depending on distances between the photodiode and the laser and between the laser and reflective surface. Scheme for measuring BG by reflection NIR-spectroscopy partially repeats the scheme used for transmission method. The main differences are in location of photodiodes on the same plane with the radiation source, while their optical axes are co-aligned and parallel to each other, and the reflecting surface tightly abuts the back wall of analytical cell with test solution. Results: The optimal distance between the photodiode and the laser is 5 mm, and between the laser and the reflective surface is 20 mm. This configuration allows intensity of the reflected radiation at about 20% of incident radiation to be obtained. Taking into account the permissible radiation density for skin, this value is enough for skin probing to a depth of 1.5 mm. Discussion: Reflection NIR-spectroscopy is promising method for non-invasive BG measurement. Research of transmission method has shown that the penetration depth of 1.5 mm is enough for receiving information about BG. Thereby mathematical apparatus applied for transmission NIR-spectroscopy can be used and similar error less than 20% can be expected.
   Objectives: Proper anatomical fitting of implants is crucial for a successful clinical outcome. However, every patient's anatomy is unique and there is a wide variety in the anatomical and morphological characteristics among individuals. Virtual fitting based on imaging data of a high number of patients has crucial benefits compared to conventional approaches during the design process. Methods: Population based engineering is a method that enables a virtual implantation combined with iterative design optimization based on 3D anatomical models created from imaging data of a high cohort of patients. This approach was successfully used during the design process of a novel inflow cannula for a Ventricular Assist Device and a Total Artificial Heart for maximizing the number of treatable patients. The objective was to create a design that contains all components, but which at the same time works for a wide variety of different body types and sizes. Results: The virtual studies have proven to give results that may not have been possible with conventional approaches. Compared with cadaver studies, this approach was a more accurate and economical way for determining the device fit and identifying areas for improvement. Clinical trials and in vivo studies of the devices have shown positive outcomes. Virtual fitting was able to reduce the risk of inflow obstruction, device-vessel misalignment, unexpected variabilities in the patient's anatomy and improper patient selection due to anatomical constraints. Discussion: Population based engineering is a cost-effective solution for including a large number of patients and anatomy variations in the design process. Additionally, this approach can be used for regulatory submission, e.g. to determine and justify anatomical and morphological eligibility or exclusion criteria for proper patient selection and/or the correct implant size. This is especially important in consideration of the future requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) for patient-specific implants.
   Objectives: None Alcoholic Fatty Liver disorders (NAFLD)is a complex systemic disorder becauseit is associated with clinical states such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes thus involving both liver and pancreas. In particular, pathological pancreas (such as in diabetic patients, in non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disorders patients) led to mis control of insulin secretion (the insulin modulates the lipid accumulation in liver). Methods: Organ on chip approaches is one way to mimic human physiology. In this paper, we will present the development of a liver, pancreas and liver pancreas co-culture model to simulate the interaction between both organs. Results: The morphological analysis confirmed the rat hepatocytes and the rat Langehrans islets were cultivated successfully after the extraction for 7 days. The tissues functionality was confirmed by the production of albumin in the liver on chip models and by the insulin secretion in the pancreas biochips. The RTqPCR analysis confirmed that the pancreas on chip culture contribute to maintain high level mRNA of genes related to glucose insulin homeostasis when compared to Petri control. Then, the GLP1 drug contribute to increase the insulin metabolism in pancreas on chip. In liver pancreas co-culture, we found that the presence of pancreas islet contributed to modify the mRNA levels of glucose-insulin homeostasis related genes in the hepatocytes. It also contributed to increase the insulin production when compared to pancreas biochip control. Discussion: Those results demonstrated the potential of our liver pancreas model to be upgraded to a complex disease model.
   Objectives: We are developing a novel autologous tissue-engineered heart valve with a unique in-body tissue engineering. This is expected to be a viable bioprosthesis with better biocompatibility. In this study, we developed a conduit-type valve without any foreign materials and tested the feasibility and long-term availability in large animal experiments. Methods: We created plastic molds for Biovalves with a 3D printer easily and quickly considering the recipient character. We embedded them in the subcutaneous spaces of adult goats for about 2 months. After extracting the molds with the tissue en-block and removing the plastic molds only, Biovalves with tri-leaflets similar to those of the native valves were constituted from completely autologous connective tissues and fibroblasts. Total 21 conduit-type Biovalves were implanted in the apico-aortic bypass or the pulmonary artery of goats, (8 and 13, respectively). No anticoagurants were used after implantation. Results: The valves were successfully implanted and showed smooth movement of the leaflets with a little regurgitation in angiogram, and the maximum duration reached to 3 years 7 months. Histological examination of the Biovalves showed the autologous cells covering the laminar surface of the valve leaflets as the endothelium and also migrating into the leaflet body to construct characteristic tissues like native leaflets. Discussion: The valves have a potential to be used for viable bioprosthetic valves and to keep better function and biocompatibility longer than current ones.
   Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to analyze the correlation between different types of dnDSA and AMR after renal transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the patients after renal transplantation from January 2002 to March 2017 in our Center. A total of 47 patients with positive PRA and confirmed as dnDSA were included, which were grouped according to the DSA binding to C1q, C3d and subtypes of IgG. Patients were divided into AMR and non-AMR groups according to the pathology of graft biopsy. Results: The pre-transplantation dialysis time of the non-AMR group was longer than that of the AMR group in 47 patients with dnDSA positive (35.4 +33.2 vs 9.8 +10.5, p=0.014). C1q-binding dnDSA had no significant effect on the graft survival after operation and biopsy. Among 47 patients with dnDSA positive, C3d-binding DSA group had lower graft survival time (p=0.009), higher HLA-DP mismatch (0.1 +/- 0.3, p=0.043) and higher percentage of pericapillary C4d deposition (p=0.042), with statistical significance. The graft survival rate of IgG3 subtype negative patients was higher than that of IgG3 subtype positive patients (p=0.003). Cox analysis found that the risk factors for graft survival included IgG3 (OR = 46.877, 95% CI = 4.211-521.830, P = 0.002), HLA-DR mismatch (OR = 0.103, 95% CI = 0.021-0.496, P = 0.005), proteinuriuria at biopsy (OR = 2.097, 95% CI = 1.184-3.713, p=0.024) and creatinine at biopsy (OR = 1.004, 95% CI = 1.001-1.007, P = 1.007) Discussion: Single-center study showed that there was no significant correlation between the incidence of AMR and different types of DSA. The accurate HLA-DR typing should be emphasized during transplantation. The monitoring of specific types of dnDSA will help us to take interventions and thus contribute to the survival of transplanted kidneys.
   Objectives: Rotary blood pumps (RBPs) are successfully used in high-risk treatments, but clot formation still threatens their long-term application. To reduce the risk of clot formation, in-vitro thrombogenicity testing could help to improve RBP design, as several studies have shown. Those studies were able to simulate in-vitro clot formation in RBPs, but they had limitations regarding a proper quantification of their thrombotic impact. In this study, we assessed if thromboelastometric analyses (TEM) are feasible to quantify the thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Methods: Five RBPs (n = 5) were placed into simple pump circuits that were built of silicone tubes and reservoirs. Each circuit was filled with 150 ml of slightly heparinized porcine blood (one donor pig per circuit) and the pumps were brought into operation. The pumps operated until a drastic drop in volume flow indicated thrombus formation. We carefully cleaned the RBPs from blood and documented any found thrombus. Prior to this, blood samples were taken at certain time points during pump operation. The blood samples were then analyzed by TEM. Results: TEM measurements showed a decrease in clotting time (CT) over the duration of the test, which indicates an ongoing increase in the activation of the coagulation system caused by the pump. Correspondingly, RBPs revealed visible blood clots at high-risk thrombus formation spots. Discussion: The decrease in CT over time corresponding to clot formation in the RBPs shows that TEM is able to detect and quantify the thrombotic impact of RBPs in-vitro. Thus, TEM could be used in future studies to compare the thrombogenicity of different RBPs by performing comparison tests similar to hemolysis testing. This could lead towards a standardization of in-vitro thrombogenicity testing of RBPs.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is very important to provide such ready-to-use products for regenerative medicine and clinical application upon demand. Although cryopreservation of isolated cells seems to be well established, there are still a number of challenges associated with the cryopreservation of native and artificial tissues due to adherent cell state, limited heat and mass transfer as well as inadequate cryopreservation protocols. Here, we aim at developing an approach for efficient cryopreservation of electrospun TECs based on multipotent stromal cells (MSCs). Methods: Blend electrospun fibre mats (fibre diameter 0.8 +/- 0.2 mu m, thickness 100 +/- 10 mu m) were produced from polycaprolactone and polylactic acid (PCL-PLA, ratio 100:50) using electrospinning. The fibre mats (diameter 16 mm) were UV sterilised and seeded with MSCs (5x104 cells/cm2). The cells were cultivated on fibre mats for 7 days under static conditions and then frozen using 1 K/min cooling rate in a controlled rate freezer with different formulations of cryoprotective agents (CPAs), such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and its combination with sucrose (with and without pre-culture with sucrose for 24 h). The viability of cells growing on fibre mats was monitored for 2 weeks after seeding and 24 h after thawing. Results: The results indicate that PCL-PLA fibre mats are biocompatible with MSCs (viability higher than 82%). Pre-culture with sucrose before freezing as well as its addition to DMSO-containing freezing medium significantly improved cell viability after thawing. Moreover, duration of equilibration of cell-seeded fibre mats with the CPAs before freezing affected cell viability post-thaw. Discussion: We showed that it is feasible to effectively cryopreserve electrospun TECs using controlled technological steps. This work could serve as a solid background for further development of efficient cryopreservation methods for biobanking of electrospun constructs for vascular or corneal tissue engineering.
   Objectives: There have been discussions on effects of pleural effusion on the breathing muscles dynamics. In particular, hemidiaphragm inversion influence on the pleural pressure (PPL) and ventilation parameters has not been precisely determined. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in PPL and ventilation parameters in patients undergoing therapeutic thoracentesis (TT). Particular attention has been paid to inversion of the hemidiaphragm caused by large one-sided pleural effusion. The analysis was based on virtual experiments performed on an artificial cardio-respiratory patient (AP). Methods: TT was simulated on AP, which consists of several cooperating models of the respiratory system mechanics, gas transport and exchange, and circulation. Three scenarios were considered: a) proper work of the diaphragm, b) flattening and fixation of the hemidiaphragm due to the large amount of fluid, c) paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm. Results: Simulations showed that during progressive pleural fluid withdrawal significant changes in the course of PPL were observed, particularly in scenarios b and c. Paradoxical excursion of the inverted hemidiaphragm significantly influenced the alveolar oxygen partial pressure (PAO2) due to a kind of pendelluft: e.g., air flows out from the corresponding lung during inspiration and thus it flows to the lung in the hemithorax without pleural effusion. Discussion: Flattening and inversion of the hemidiaphragm have an influence on several physiological factors of which PPL and PAO2 seem to be the most important. Hence, TT may improve pulmonary system function particularly in patients with inverted hemidiaphragm.
   Objectives: Bone loss at implantation sites on oral cavities is a major problem for dental surgeons; in order to combat this issue, we developed 3 types of colagen biomaterial blends: chondrohitin sulfate, carbon nanotubes, and electric stimulated. Methods: Bovine colagen type I was dissoluted at 4% in formic acid 0,1M (Synth - Brazil) and divided in 4 groups: A- with Chondroitin Sulphate (Sigma Aldrich); B - carbon nanotubes suspention (Sigma Aldrich); C- eletric field ; D - control group. All of the samples were crosslinked with NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide esters) (Thermo Scientific-USA) and freeze dried at a LH2000 equipment (Terroni - Brazil). The samples were analized by: SEM; EDS; XPS; Bartha respirometry and FET. Results: All of the samples have the same macroscopic morphology. The SEM of the group submitted to electric field shows organization of the colagen fibers. The EDS shows atomic content of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen with other substances Discussion: The absence of contaminants within the samples and the increase in stiffness exhibit the compatibility of this material for use in bone augmentation in implantology. The material is shown to be not toxic, however more tests should be conducted prior to human use.
   Objectives: The optimization of the long term storage of cells and tissues is a challenging process with many variables but one factor is often overlooked: the freezing device itself. There are freezing containers that have to be placed in a -80 degrees C freezer and the manufacturer promises a cooling rate of 1 K/min. On the other hand there are controlled rate freezers where cooling rates from 0.1 K/min up to 50 K/min are promised. In this study we compared two commercially available freezing containers and four controlled rate freezers with respect to their functioning principle. Furthermore, we investigated the accuracy of the adjusted cooling rate and the nucleation temperature of the samples. Methods: Seven 1.5 ml cryovials filled with 1 ml 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride solution were dispersed evenly over the rack of each freezing device. Constantan thermocouples (type T) connected to a RedLab device were placed in the middle of the solution of each cryovial to record temperatures every second with the respective software. The cooling rates were calculated from the melting point (-0.6 degrees C) of the solution to -30 degrees C with n=3. For all freezing devices a cooling rate of 1 K/min was set according to the manufacturers guidelines. Results: The freezing containers had sample cooling rates between 0.5 and 0.8 K/min. All controlled rate freezers showed cooling rates similar to the programmed cooling rate of 1 K/min. Higher cooling rates resulted in increasing deviations between programmed and measured cooling rates. The nucleation temperatures of the samples in the freezing containers were mainly between 0 degrees C and -6 degrees C. However, the controlled rate freezers showed nucleation temperatures mainly in the range of -6 degrees C to -12 degrees C. Discussion: Varying definitions from each manufacturer resulted in the observed cooling rate differences of the freezing containers. Limited heat transfer accounted for the increased cooling rate deviation recorded in higher programmed cooling rates.
   Objectives: Patients using ventricular assist devices (VADs) still suffer from adverse events such as pump malfunctions or thromboembolic events. This can be caused by thrombi that have formed inside the pump (pump thrombus). Therefore, there is a great need to prevent such adverse events through engineering measures in the early development stage of blood pumps. Currently, a numerical model to predict thrombus sites inside VADs is still missing and the risk can only be assessed with in vitro experiments in the late development stage. A recently found model for thrombus formation at high shear rates that was derived from simple stenosis experiments promises great potential in the application in computational simulations (CFD) of VADs. Methods: In this study, advanced high resolution URANS simulations of rotational blood pumps were conducted with the flow solver of StarCCM+ (Siemens) at an operating point of 5L/min at 75 mmHg. A k- omega SST turbulence model and the sliding mesh method was applied. The existing model for predicting high shear thrombus formation was applied and compared with observations from explanted pumps. Based on these results a modification of that model is proposed that suggests a wall normal transport due to the change of shear rate in flow direction. This modification was realized in the CFD by applying a correlation between the computed direction of the pressure gradient and the flow direction. Results: The application of the model shows that thrombus sites are overpredicted in rotational blood pumps when compared with experimental results or observations from explanted pumps. However, with a modification of the model which proposes that the influence is a wall normal transport due to a change in shear rate, a good agreement was found. Discussion: Since there is little data available in the literature that shows the position of pump thrombi the validity of these models remains unclear and has to be experimentally evaluated further.
   Objectives: Cryptogenic stroke is the cause of 40% of ischaemic acute cerebrovascular events. Study aim was to evaluate the recurrence of ischaemic cerebrovascular events in patients successfully treated by percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO). Methods: From February 2004 to January 2019, 314 symptomatic (243 stroke, 71 TIA) patients, (153 M 161 F; mean age 41 yrs, range 10-69) underwent percutaneous closure of PFO. 151 patients/314 (48%) had concomitant migraine, 90 (60%) with aura. 7 different occluder devices were implanted by transesophageal echocardiography, for a total of 317 implants. During follow-up all patients underwent clinical (Rankin modified scale) and quality of life (SF36) evaluations, transcranial Doppler (TCD), trans-thoracic echocardiography, and MRI. Cerebral and angio-MR assessed the degree of lesions by quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis performed before and after treatment. Sizes of lesions were measured by manual segmentation on the axial, coronal and sagittal images acquired. Results: Successful device deployment was achieved in 99% of pateints; patients were discharged home within 3 days. Follow-up was 100% complete (median 55.4, range 1-178 months). At 6 months, Rankin scale was 0 (p<0.0001) in 230 patients (95%) affected by stroke and 10 patients reached score 1. Quality of life improved significantly (P<0.0001). In 101/151 patients (67%) with migraine, intensity and frequency of attacks significantly decreased (P<0.0001). TCD showed residual microembolic signals in 10 patients, 3 patients required secondary successful treatment for an associate defect. TTE (after 1, 3, 6, 12 months and once a year for 5 years) showed optimal sealing of all devices without signs of erosion, incomplete closure and thrombus. In 265 patients cerebral MRI showed no new lesions at 2 years. Discussion: Our 15 year experience suggests that percutaneous treatment of PFO is safe and beneficial for secondary prevention of recurrence of acute cerebrovascular events irrespective of the device used.
   Objectives: Endovascular stent grafting is the standard treatment for patients with acute traumatic aortic rupture with extensive associated lesions. Very little long term information is available in large series. Methods: From March 1999 to September 2018, 83 patients (72 M and 11 F; mean age: 37.25 +/- 13.46;range 16 to 69) admitted with acute or chronic traumatic aortic lesions underwent endovascular repair. 60 cases had acute traumatic aortic rupture, due to road accidents in 69 patients and accidental falls in 3 patients. All procedures were carried out in the angiography suite. Left subclavian artery was always identified. Patients were followed-up in the out-patient clinic and by yearly angio CT-scan with regard to survival and complications. The follow-up was 100% complete. Results: Endovascular stent-graft treatment was successful in all cases of acute or chronic aortic injury. No post-operative paraplegia occurred. Control angiography showed optimal sealing and complete exclusion of the pseudo-aneurysm from blood flow with no primary endoleak. Patients underwent treatment of all associated lesions later on during hospital stay. Two patients died in the hospital: 1 patient of cerebral haemorrhage and 1 patient of sepsis. During the follow-up 5 patients died (survival: 91.4%) for causes unrelated to the aortic procedure. no cases of perigraft leakage or aortic disruption were detected. During follow-up 1 patient had a steal syndrome and 1 patient paraplegia due to the covering of the left subclavian artery by endovascular graft. 4 years after treatment 1 patient had inner thrombosis of the graft developing a gradient; a new endovascular stent graft was deployed successfully. Freedom from complications was 92.3%. Discussion: The outcomes over 20 years of follow-up proves that endovascular stent graft repair is the first choice treatment in patients with traumatic aortic injuries. Our experience demonstrates the feasibility and safety of endovascular treatment including patients with extensive associated injuries.
   Objectives: In vitro simulation of an in vivo environment for human stem cell research is crucial for any kind of biomedical purpose. While important factors like 3D-cultivation and physiological oxygen concentrations gain more attention in the scientific community, we still lack reliable methods to visualize the hypoxic response of cells in 2D and 3D in vitro systems. In this study we present human adipose-derived MSCs, modified with a genetically encoded hypoxia-sensor. Methods: We used a lentiviral system to stably integrate the genetic construct into the chromosomal DNA of mesenchymal stem cells. To investigate the features of this novel biosensor we cultivated our cells in a 2D- and 3D-environment under various oxygen levels and evaluated the outset of biosensor-fluorescence via microscopy and flow cytometry. Results: The hypoxia sensor was successfully integrated in mesenchymal stem cells and could easily be induced by cultivating the cells in a hypoxic condition. MSCs, modified with hypoxia biosensors could be cultivated up to passage 20. Trilineage differentiation of MSCs (adipogenous, osteogenous and chondrogenouse differentiation) was also preserved by the cells after transfection. Using these cells we could monitor which 3D-cultivation conditions lead to hypoxic response of MSCs. Discussion: Our findings can help to improve our understanding of the influence of cultivation conditions on in situ oxygen concentrations. Moreover, by choosing the right 3D cultivation system, MSC can be cultivated in vitro under physiological hypoxic conditions.
   Objectives: Heart failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) is a progressive disease with a low 5-year survival of <50%, which affects 23 million people worldwide. It is characterized by adverse remodeling of the left ventricle (dilated cardiomyopathy) due to an increase in filling pressures and myocardial wall stress. Pharmacological treatment and cardiac resynchronisation therapy have proven beneficial for survival. For patients with end-stage heart failure, a heart transplant or Left Ventricular Assist Device can be considered. A shortage of donors, patient selection and major downsides such as invasiveness and driveline infections limit the use of these treatments. Research has shown a 13% decrease in mortality for every 5% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction. Therefore, we developed a smart memory alloy configuration in order to increase the ejection fraction and obtain an increase of 3,5% in a bench model. To cope with ongoing left ventricular dilatation and rise in wall stress, this should be combined with adjustable and measurable ventricular restraint therapy. Our first aim is to measure local wall stress during a full cardiac cycle. Next, we aim to develop a mathematical model of the left ventricle to characterize the left ventricle in HFrEF patients. Methods: We will characterize in vivo wall stresses during the full cardiac cycle using Transesophageal Echocardiography and a left ventricular pressure catheter in 10 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for heart failure. With these parameters, we will develop a simplified mathematical model of the left ventricle and we will improve our bench model for experimental testing. Results: This research will provide a characterization of the weakened left ventricular wall and the determination of optimal smart material properties and configuration of the cardiac assist device. Discussion: With this information, a patient-specific HFrEF treatment device will be developed combining active cardiac support and restraint therapy.
   Objectives: Clinical data on the hemocompatibility of membranes used in double filtration lipoprotein apheresis (LP) is virtually unavailable. The present trial compared the hemocompatibility of a recently introduced polyethersulfone (PES) based plasma fractionator membrane, FractioPES (R) 200, to an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL) membrane during LP. Methods: In a prospective, randomized, controlled, crossover trial, eight patients on routine LP were subjected to one treatment with PES plasma (0.6 m(2), 3M PlasCure (R) 0.6) and fractionation (1.9 m(2), 3M SelectiCure (R) H19) membranes and one control treatment using a set of EVAL membranes (0.5 m(2), Asahi Plasmaflo OP-05W; 2.0 m(2), Asahi Cascadeflo EC-50W). Intraindividual treatment conditions were kept identical. At defined times, samples were drawn at different sites of the extracorporeal blood and plasma circuit to measure white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PC) counts, complement factor C5a and thrombin-anti-thrombin III (ATIII). Results: With a nadir at 25 min, WBC in EVAL decreased to 34 % of baseline vs. 64 % at 20 min in PES (P<0.001). PC only marginally decreased over time with both membrane types. Maximum C5a in venous blood was 30.0 +/- 11.2 mu g/L at 30 min with EVAL and 14.0 +/- 12.8 mu g/L at 25 min with PES (P<0.001). Compared to PES (23.3 +/- 15.2 at 5 min and 16.9 +/- 12.3 at 20 min, resp.), highest C5a concentrations were found in plasma after the EVAL plasma (56.1 +/- 22.0 mu g/L at 10 min; P<0.001) and fractionation filters (50.6 +/- 19.4 mu g/L at 30 min; P<0.001). ATIII levels did not rise until the end of the treatment without differences between membranes. Regarding Lp(a), LDL and HDL removal, both membrane sets performed equally (PES, 69.8 +/- 5.7, 64.9 +/- 8.8, and 17.4 +/- 13.6 %, resp., vs. EVAL, 69.5 +/- 6.0, 65.2 +/- 6.9, and 18.2 +/- 7.3 %, resp.). Discussion: Compared to EVAL, PES membranes are more beneficial with respect to the classical hemocompatibility of extracorporeal treatment procedures, namely leukocyte and complement system activation.
   Objectives: Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has become a standard therapy for adult end-stage heart failure patients. For pediatric patients, technological development lags behind with no currently approved implantable rotary blood pump. As an alternative, the HeartWare HVAD, originally designed for adults, is increasingly used in pediatric patients. The aim of this multicenter study was to assess in-silico, in-vitro and in-vivo the blood trauma potential of this pump in pediatric application. Methods: Blood trauma potential of the HVAD was investigated in-silico and in-vitro at an adult and pediatric operating point (5L/min and 2.5L/min at 2800rpm and 2200rpm, respectively). The flow was simulated by computational fluid dynamics and analyzed regarding flow structures, shear stresses and washout. Hemolysis was assessed with pumps circulating bovine blood in a temperate flow circuit. Clinical outcome and indicators for in-vivo blood trauma were investigated retrospectively in 14 pediatric HVAD patients (age 11.3 +/- 4.8years). Results: In the pediatric conditions, simulations predicted elevated mechanical stress profile below 50mPa, more stagnant flow field, with longer washout times within the pump. In-vitro measurements revealed an increased normalized index of hemolysis (NIH = 17.5 mg/100L vs. 8.2 mg/100L, (p=0.0021)). In the retrospective in vivo analysis, LDH and D-Dimer values were 1.5 and 3-fold elevated, respectively, compared to adult HVAD patients. Major bleedings were observed in 42.9%, suspected pump thrombosis and neurologic dysfunction in 14.3% of all patients. Discussion: The HVAD, operated at lower speeds and flows, induces elevated blood trauma. These results highlight the need for specifically adapted ventricular assist devices, optimized for the pediatric population. Further studies are required to assess the clinical implications of these findings.
   Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis, but it still has high rate of failure due to stenosis formation. Convincing evidence supports a key role of local hemodynamics in vascular remodeling, suggesting that disturbed flow conditions may be related to stenosis development. The purpose of our investigation was to explore the feasibility of coupling non-contrast enhanced MRI and high-resolution computational fluid dynamics (HR-CFD) to relate morphological vessel changes to local hemodynamics in AVF over time. Methods: We acquired non-contrast enhanced 3D fast spin echo MRI (CUBE T1) at 1 and 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after radio-cephalic AVF creation in one patient. We generated 3D models and evaluated lumen cross-sectional area changes over time. We perfomed CFD simulations using pimpleFoam solver of OpenFoam, prescribing blood flow waveforms derived by Ultrasound examination. We computed the 2 components of the wall shear stress vector over time, namely WSSdir, the component in the mean direction of the WSS vector and WSStr, the transversal component. Results: We observed a dilatation of the vein until 6 months, with a more pronounced increase in the venous outflow as compared to the juxta-anastomotic vein (JAV). The increase in vein's diameter was then followed by a narrowing of JAV at 1 year after AVF surgery. We found high-frequency fluctuations both for WSSdir and WSStr components, in different locations of the vein, at 6 weeks and 6 months after AVF creation. Oscillations of both components damped at 1 year after AVF creation, as a result of vessel remodeling. Discussion: Optimized CUBE T1, coupled with HR-CFD, allowed a characterization of morphological and hemodynamic changes over time. Our MRI-to-CFD pipeline represents a promising approach to elucidate mechanisms of local vascular remodeling and can be used for clinical investigations aimed at identifying critical hemodynamic factors responsible for AVF failure.
   Objectives: For 30 years, the mortality rate of patients hospitalized in intensive care unit has been drastically reduced. But an increase in muscle dysfunctions at the end of intensive care stay, leading to long term functional disability was observed at the same time. The physiological mechanism remains poorly understood due to a lack of study tools. The objective of this work is therefore to create a new tool for the tissue construction of an in vitro skeletal muscle. This tool should allow a muscle construction which mimics physiological reality, in order to model the disease more accurately. Also, it should allow mechanical and electrical stimulation in order to simulate the resumption of muscle contraction of patients. Methods: Using sol-gel process, we synthesized a new biomaterial, based on an epoxy organic-inorganic hybrid precursor (g-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane). This biomaterial was deposited as a thin layer (spin-coating process) of 7 mu m thickness on a silicone membrane suitable to undergo mechanical stretching. The biomaterial was microstructured using the UV laser writing lithography to create a line network. This line network was revealed with a 2-minute isopropanol bath and we obtained lines of 8 mu m thickness spaced of 175 mu m. To ensure a biological environment and a strong adhesion of cells on microstructured silicone support during mechanical stretching, we grafted silylated bioactive peptides using dip-coating process. Results: Muscular stem cells which were isolated from patients' quadriceps biopsy were seemed and, by immunofluorescence staining, we observed a growth of muscle fibers along the lines, mimicking the physiological organization of a muscle. Discussion: We were able to model the first stages of a complex muscle organoid in vitro using a new tool manufactured by a fast, simple and reproducible process. With the mechanical and electrical stimulation of this muscle-on-a-chip, this work should allow us to better understand these muscle dysfunctions and find new treatments.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation of 'ready-to-use' tissue-engineered constructs (TECs) is a promising strategy which may facilitate their future clinical application. This is very challenging and ambitious task and therefore recent efforts have been focused on developing new cryopreservation strategies for long-term storage of TECs. This work covers some practical considerations for cryopreservation of cell-free and cell-seeded scaffolds vastly differing by structure and composition. Methods: The first test system includes 3D porous collagen-hydroxyapatite (HAP) scaffolds prepared by freeze-drying and coaxial alginate macrospheres prepared by electrospraying. Samples were frozen at 1 K/min either in a bulk DMSO solution (with and without sucrose) or after removal of residual solution. After thawing, we evaluated compression (collagen-HAP scaffolds) and rheological properties (coaxial alginate macrospheres) of cell-free systems. Viability of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) within both types of scaffolds was evaluated 24-h post-thaw using live-dead assay. The second test system comprises flat fiber mats (produced from polycaprolactone/polylactic acid using electrospinning) seeded with CHO cells. This system intends to develop plate electrodes for electroporation of attached cells with non-permeable cryoprotective agents (CPAs) such as sugars for future cryopreservation applications. Results: All scaffolds were cytocompatible with corresponding cell types. Freezing after removal of residual solution was superior to conventional freezing. Addition of sucrose increased cell viability (both scaffold types) and improved viscoelastic properties of coaxial macrospheres. Constructed plate electrodes provided good compromise between high cell permeabilisation and viability after electroporation with sucrose at 1.7 kV/cm electric field. Discussion: The findings suggest that it is feasible to cryopreserve cell-free and cell-seeded scaffolds using DMSO and sucrose. As a step further, there are high expectations associated with using electroporation as a mean for intracellular delivery of non-toxic CPAs towards DMSO-free cryopreservation of TECs.
   Objectives: Tailored Forming is a new manufacturing technology to manufacture solid components out of two or more different metals. The components are joined to a hybrid semi-finished workpiece. Afterwards, a forming process is performed to improve the materials properties. This allows creating hybrid metallic parts that are adjusted to their specific loads and their field of application in comparison to parts made out of monomaterials. The potential use case of Tailored Forming-parts is still being researched. Biomedical implants are a potential field of application. In the presented study, the contact mechanics of two potential concepts for Tailored Forming hip implants were analysed. Methods: Both concepts consist of a magnesium component that should be resorbed in the human body and leads to a better bone growth. A second component in the implants is used to absorb loads. In a numerical analysis the two implants were compared to a conventional implant. For the potential evaluation two load cases "walking" and "walking upstairs" were considered. Results: While one concept leads to higher stresses in the implant, the other concept shows almost similar stress distributions as the conventional implant and has the additional advantage of the better bone growth due to the magnesium component. Discussion: Based on this work further research on different implant concepts has to be made to give a clear statement about the potential of Tailored Forming-Implants.
   Objectives: In consideration of the recently published implant files, testing of medical devices has gained signifigant importance. Many medical implants are subject to normative testing during their regulatory approval process, such as stents, heart valves and blood pumps. No testing norm or standard, however, exists for regulatory approval of left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Therefore, this study aimed to establish in-vitro bench tests for LAA occlusion (LAAo) devices and compares the clinically most widely used devices. Methods: Seven different LAA occlusion systems with device diameter ranging between 22 and 34 mm were tested regarding tug force and radial force resulting in a total of 24 devices. Radial force was assessed in a commercially available tester whereas tug force was evaluated in a novel in-vitro test setup consisting of bovine tissue. Results: Significant differences in the mechanical properties of the different devices were observed. Radial force ranged between 8.6 N at maximum compression for the LAmbre 2228 device and 0.1 N for the Occlutech 27 mm implant at minimum compression. A similar variability of mechanical properties was seen in the tug test results. Values ranged from 4.6 N to 0.4 N for the Wavecrest 22 mm and the Occlutech 24 mm device, respectively, at maximum and minimum compression. Discussion: Large variations in mechanical properties were seen between the different devices. The study showed that device stability is more dependent on anchoring structures, such as hooks and barbs, than on radial force. A strong positive correlation between the number of anchoring structures per millimeter circumference of an occluder and its tug force was found (r=0.87, p < 0.01). The large variations in mechanical properties aggravate comparison of current LAA occlusion devices which underlines the need for standardized preclinical testing to prompt clinical compatibility.
   Objectives: Pump thrombosis is a severe adverse event in ventricular assist devices. Current therapy often involves an exchange of the entire pump. Alternative solutions must be explored to reduce surgery numbers. A protocol for in vitro lysis of LVAD specific thrombus with alteplase was established in this study. Methods: A fluid chamber of silicone tubing was filled with isotonic sodium chloride solution. An artificial human thrombus was suspended within. Alteplase was added to the system according to the maximum dose for clinical use, 0.028 mg/ml. Five experiments each were conducted for stasis and fibrin thrombi respectively. Both types were lysis tested for four and 24 hours each. Fluid samples and photographs were taken for dissolution evaluation. Results: Visual inspection of the fibrin thrombus showed clear dissolution. For the stasis thrombus, the 24 h experiment produced no discernible dissolution of the thrombi, while the thrombi investigated over the 4 h period fragmented into small pieces which did not dissolve entirely. D-dimer levels in the fibrin thrombus tests rose steadily through the alteplase treatment for both test durations (short test 12800-25600 ng/ml, long test 25600-51200 ng/ml). For the short term stasis thrombus testing, D-dimer values rose similarly to the fibrin thrombus, but levels remained much lower (short test 1600-3200 ng/ml, long test >200 ng/ml). Long term stasis thrombus tests showed no significant rise in D-dimer levels. Discussion: Alteplase was successful in dissolving fibrin thrombi in our experimental setup. D-dimer analysis supported the visual impression. The fragmentation of stasis thrombi and D-dimer levels measured may be due to the drug's fibrinolytic effect. The amount of erythrocytes in a stasis thrombus may resist lysis and produce challenges in the clinical application of thrombus lysis treatment. With this setup we were able to examine the reaction of the LVAD thrombi to Alteplase. This information can be used to further optimise clinical lysis therapy.
   Objectives: Methylprednisolon pulse therapy was used in the initial phase of induction therapy in some patients. This study was conducted in order to examine the short and long term effect of methylprednisolone pulse therapy for the lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy. Methods: The retrospective study included 43 patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis receiving muti-target therapy in our center, including prednisone combined with MMF and tacrolimus. 19 patients received methylprednisolon pulse therapy in the initial phase of induction therapy, 24 patients only received prednisone combined with MMF and tacrolimus. The dose of methylprednisolonpulse therapy was intravenous injection 500mgx3 days and the following prednisone dose was 0.8-1.0mg/kg. We compared the primary and secondary outcomes of the two groups. In the patients combined with acute renal injury (AKI) subgroup, we also compared the primary and secondary outcomes between the two groups. Results: In the primary outcome, the CR rates are similar between the two groups. We did not find significant difference in the total remission rate (either complete or partial) between the two groups (p=0.93). The same is true for the remission time (p=0.87). There was no significant difference in the time and number of patients entering hemodialysis between the two groups (p=0.65). Although, in the AKI subgroup, there was a significant difference in the serum creatinine between the two groups in 1 month (P=0.045). However, there was no significant difference in the following up, and the probability of achieving CR and replase (calculated by using the Kaplan - Meier method) also had no significant difference. Discussion: Methylprednisolon pulse therapy seemed to have no significant effect on the long-term prognosis of lupus nephritis treated with muti-target therapy and it could not delay the patients' entry into hemodialysis. However, it may have had a better effect on the recovery of AKI patients and rapid relief of inflammatory reactions.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate intradialytic on-line multicomponent total removed solutes (TRS) monitoring in the spent dialysate, as potentially more objective parameter for removal of uremic solute markers urea, indoxyl sulfate (IS), and beta 2-Microglobulin (B2M) compared to relative indices as removal ratio, using a novel miniaturized optical sensor during hemodialysis (HD) and hemodiafiltration (HDF) with different settings. Methods: Ten ESKD patients (6 M and 4 F, 60.2 +/- 16.8 yrs) on chronic HDF were followed during 5 midweek dialysis sessions each (length 240min, HD: N=1, Qb=200ml/min, Qd=300ml/min, FX60; HDF: N=4, Qb > 300ml/min, Qd > 500ml/min, Vsubst > 15l, FX800 and FX1000). Spent dialysate from the drain was monitored on-line by a miniaturized sensor prototype (Optofluid Technologies Ou, Estonia). For total dialysate collection method as the reference, a spent dialysate sample from the tank at the end of each dialysis session was taken. The concentrations of urea and B2M were determined in the clinical laboratory. Concentration of IS was determined utilizing the HPLC. Based on differences between laboratory and optical sensor TRS values BIAS and standard error (SE) were calculated. A t-test was used to determine significant differences (P <= 0.05). Results: The average TRS values of optical sensor and laboratory were 510 +/- 86mM/L and 485 +/- 106mM/L for urea, 224 +/- 41mg/L and 228 +/- 47mg/L for B2M, and 732 +/- 371 mu M/L and 719 +/- 392 mu M/L for IS, respectively. No statistical differences were found between optical and laboratory TRS values for any uremic solute. The relative BIAS +/- SE values of the TRS were -7.99 +/- 19.43% for urea, 0.07 +/- 15.60% for B2M, and -4.72 +/- 13.25% for IS, respectively. Discussion: Novel miniaturized optical sensor successfully carried out intradialytic on-line multicomponent TRS monitoring in the spent dialysate.
   Objectives: Perioperative tight glycemic control (TGC) and management is of paramount importance during perioperative treatment of patients with multiorgan failure. Recent results have shown that such interoperative TGC led to an improvement of morbidity and mortality and to a prevention of Surgical site infection (SSI) in ICU patients. Consequently, a user-friendly device combining glucose analysis and delivery of glucose and insulin should allow for better therapies. Methods: Based on an already existing artificial pancreas device (STG-22), a new artificial endocrine pancreas system (STG-55) was developed. With a battery incorporated, it uses again a closed loop analytical system. Due to its in-built sensors, the closed-loop system allows for a quick and easy feed-back analysis of patient data through already established algorithms for glucose and insulin infusion. With the help of a disposable modular tubing circuit blood sampling from the patient's vein is realized and assessed by an automatically calibrated sensor. The device exhibits a maneuverable weight of only 36 kg and can be set-up within a single hour. Results: Clinical trials with STG-55, in Japan (Kochi University Hospital) have proven its re not sign liable practicability. Glucose monitoring was stable and results comparable to the analyses of an independent glucose analyzer with a high correlation coefficient. Due to appropriate insulin administration, no hypoglycemia was observed in patients under investigation. Discussion: The advent of new technological tools, such as miniaturized analytical devices in combination with the application of patient-specific precise algorithms allows for a strict and successful therapy without hypoglycemia in perioperative patients. With the new design and concept of STG-55, the set-up time for the artificial pancreas can be reduced down to 30% of preexisting devices, which finally makes a glucose and insulin management in both the interoperative and the ICU user friendly.
   The generation of complex cellular structures for human application often requires a matrix, defining the three-dimensional shape and mechanical properties of the artificial tissue. The matrix as such is not viable. If this matrix is of human origin, Directive 2004/23/EC (in its national version) shall apply. In that case only "non-substantial" processing methods may be utilized, which are specified in Regulation 1294/2007/EC. For example, non-cellular substances can be extracted from the tissue, so-called derivatives. These derivatives, if of human origin, are also tissues within the meaning of Directive 2004/23/EC. If these derivatives are further processed, or if the tissue originates from animals, the matrix is classified as a medical device. The Human Tissue Authority describes the delimitation as follows: "Derivatives of non-viable tissues and cells such collagen fillers (i.e. collagen extracted from tissues and cells) fall under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). Non-viable tissue and cell products such as demineralized bone matrix, or acellular human tissues or tissue matrices, will not be covered by the MDR. They will continue to fall under the Directive 2004/23/EC." The paper deals in more detail with the problem of demarcation and describes the consequences of this in practice. We will discuss the problem of demarcation in more detail as well as describe the consequences in practical implementation.
   Objectives: In this study, two attempts of new biomaterial development based on the latest results of cell biology and tissue engineering are reported. One is specific cell separation using DNA as linker, and another is novel hybrid materials constructed by decellularized tissues complexed with synthetic polymer. Methods: Antibody was immobilized via desthiobiotin-avidin interaction. Single strand DNA (20mer) was chemically immobilized on the surface and then antibody (anti-mouse CD45, mCD45) modified with the complementary single strand DNA was immobilized on the surface through DNA duplex formation. Decellularized porcine dermis was prepared and lyophilized. After that, methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer were immersed in stages, then polymerization was proceeded. The obtained hybrid material was analyzed by tensile strength and SEM observation. Results: Cells were also adhered on the surface at 37 degrees C and detached by 4 degrees C incubation with remaining cells that interacted with the surface via antibody-antigen interaction. The adhered cells were released by DNase treatment. These results suggest that cells can be selectively captured and collected by using the surface that immobilizes an antibody via dissociation molecules. The monomer absorption depends strongly on the tissue structure. Gradient-type decellularized dermis-poly(methyl methacrylate) complex was prepared by controlling the permeation time of the methyl methacrylate monomer. The mechanical strength of this complex gradually increased from the dermis side to the polymer side. Discussion: Developing new biomaterials combining new knowledge among different science discipline is an indispensable methodology for the next generation of medical development. The materials presented here are example of these biomaterials, and show the direction of future biomaterial development.
   Objectives: This investigation discusses the method of electrical stimulation of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and skin fibroblasts (FB) growing on substrates composed by carbon nanotubes and organic compounds. Methods: Substrates were produced from a water dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes and organic compounds (serum albumin, collagen, chitosan) and formed by evaporation of the liquid component using infrared laser radiation. Laser exposure stimulated the formation of conductive nanotube clusters responsible for electrical signal transmission to the cells, and organic compounds improved cell adhesion due to the presence of cell membrane receptors sensitive to matrix proteins and aminosugar molecules. An aseptic system for electrical cell stimulation included an electric pulse generator, culture plate with cells with a breadboard and electrodes made of surgical steel with gold plating. Cells were stimulated for 48 hours with pulsed electric signal (60-200 mV amplitude, 1 ms pulse duration, 1 s pause) directly inside the CO2-incubator. Results: The effects of electrical stimulation on the cell proliferation were estimated by MTT-test. It was found that both MSC and FB are sensitive to the stimulus, but the most prominent increase of cell proliferation was detected at 80 mV pulse amplitude. In these conditions, a 13 and 16 percent augmentation of cell growth rate was obtained for MSC and FB, respectively. Similar results (the formation of denser cell monolayer) were achieved by fluorescent microscopy of cell nuclei stained by ethidium bromide and fluorescein diacetate. No pathological changes in cell morphology were observed. Discussion: The obtained results suggest that MSC and FB growing on conductive substrates are sensitive to electrical stimulation. This observation can be explained by the activation of potential-controlled ion channels and the stimulation of metabolic processes that accelerate cell growth.
   Objectives: The Modular Extracorporeal Lung Assist System (ModELAS) is a highly compact, modular, fully integrated pump-lung. The device can be configured to provide adult low-flow extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) (removal of 30-50% of metabolic CO2), full adult respiratory support or full pediatric respiratory support. The modular design allows for the exchange of the 0.65 m(2) adult bundle and the 0.3 m(2) pediatric bundle, while all other device components are identical. These studies characterized the in vivo performance of the ModELAS for each application. Methods: In vivo device performance was evaluated in healthy sheep (n=4 7-day ECCO2R, n=6 30-day adult ECMO, n=3 7-day pediatric ECMO). Pediatric studies utilized a right atrium to pulmonary artery cannulation strategy while adult studies utilized a dual lumen cannula placed in the jugular vein. Animals were recovered and tethered within a pen. The target blood flow rate was 0.5 L/min for ECCO2R and 2-3 L/min for the ECMO applications. Anticoagulation was achieved via continuous heparin infusion. Animal hemodynamics were measured hourly, and blood chemistry, gas transfer and plasma free hemoglobin (PfHb) were measured throughout each study. Results: All animals were recovered and 9 animals completed the full study duration. Average CO2 removal during ECCO2R was 74 +/- 6 mL/min. Average adult and pediatric oxygenation was 134 +/- 10 mL/min and 94 +/- 11 mL/min, respectively. Average PfHb was less than 25 mg/dL, with the exception of one study following an acute kidney injury. Early terminations were due to a pulmonary embolism, a hemothorax, an intra-bundle thrombus and a fractured cannula. Typical explanted devices exhibited minimal thrombus. When present, thrombi were primarily located at the bundle inlet surface and impeller pivot. Discussion: These studies are on-going, but demonstrate positive performance of the ModELAS across a clinically relevant respiratory support spectrum.
   Objectives: Various modes of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with or without a pump have been used as a bridge to lung transplantation in clinical settings. We have started to develop a large animal model for testing newly developed artificial lungs that can be used as a long-term bridging device. Methods: A total of eight goats weighing 40-55 kg were used. A membrane lung (Capiox EBS (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) accompanied by a centrifugal pump (Emersave (R), Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was connected to the pulmonary artery (PA) trunk for outflow, and the left atrial (LA) appendage for inflow. The PA pressure (PAP), systemic arterial pressure (AP), pre- and post-oxygenator pressures were monitored. The blood flow of the main PA and the membrane lung were monitored continuously by using an ultrasonic perivascular probe (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, NY). The blood flow to the membrane lung was maintained at around 2.0 L/min during the trials. Results: Four out of eight goats did not survive because of initial surgical failures (N=2), and introducing air bubbles in the membrane lungs (N=2). Other four goats were successfully kept for device testing. Durations of the circuit run were 7, 16, 24, and 48 days with or without heparin infusions according to the experimental protocols. Mean AP and mean PAP at the recovery from the surgery were 81 +/- 16 mmHg and 19 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively. The PA flow rate was 4.4 +/- 0.5 L/min. Discussion: The animal model for testing long-term membrane lung application as PA-to-LA configuration has been established. The model makes it possible for us to assess artificial lungs in vivo setting for long-term with stable blood flow through the device.
   Objectives: The effectiveness of the inhaled drugs is strictly related to the areas which are reachable by the drug particles. Unless the particles reach the desired part of the bronchial tree, their influence might not meet the required expectations and consequently the disease progress might not be stopped. Therefore, the primary objective of this research was to analyze the airflow patterns and particles deposition of a standard inhaled drug, commonly used during the treatment of asthma, with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The study was devoted to the analysis of the particles diameter influence on their deposition areas within the entire respiratory tract. Methods: Two patient-specific respiratory tract models, for 6 and 12-year-old patients, were reconstructed basing on the DICOM image sets obtained during the Computed Tomography Examinations. The reconstruction of the digital models was performed within the Mimics Research 20.0 program, whereas the meshes were prepared with the use of the Ansys ICEM package. Numerical analyses were carried out as stationary ones with the constant inflow of the particles of various diameters (within the range of 1.0-50.0 mu m). Results: It was proven that depending on the particles size, their deposition within the respiratory tract varies significantly. The vast majority of the particles with diameters over 20 mu m are gathered on the walls of the throat, whereas particles of diameters 5-15 mu m are accumulating mainly on the trachea walls, leaving the alveoli insufficiently supplied with the drug particles. Similar phenomena could be observed for both investigated cases of the reconstructed geometries. Discussion: The significant changes of the drug particle distribution resulting from the various diameters of the particles indicate that the inhaled drug size cannot be treated as negligible factor during the drug spraying. Improper distribution of the particles, i.e. their aggregation on the wall of the throat and trachea, might not inhibit the symptoms of the asthma.
   Objectives: The improvement of immunosuppressive strategies have signifigantly reduced the risk and mortality of cellular rejection after Heart Transplantation (HTx). Recently, Humoral Rejection and antibodies have been recognized as a major problem in the management of recipients during the follow-up. Methods: 23 patients out of more than 700 recipients undergoing HTx and 6 undergoing retransplantation required techniques of apheretic medicine to manage Humoral Rejection episodes or to lead to transplant patients with Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA). Results: In our experience 4 patients were treated with photopheresis with excellent tolerability, no adverse event and no rejection episodes. Photopheresis was added on top of standard immunosuppressive therapy in patients requiring minimization of calcineurins due to other clinical conditions. 19 patients experiencing humoral rejection were treated alternatively with Plasma Exchange (8 patients) or with immunoadsorption. Plasma Exchange was preferred in acute patients requiring removal of inflammatory factors other than antibodies while Immunoabsorption was better tolerated and adopted to reduce the metabolic impact and coagulative disorders when the patient was more stable. Discussion: Apheretic Medicine has opened a new door and represents an efficient weapon in the armamentarium of an HTx center. The complexity of the management of this new diseased in frail patients highlights the need for a multidisciplinary group establishing the right treatment for every patient.
   Realheart TAH is designed to imitate the construction of the human heart in order to create a blood flow as natural as possible. Realheart TAH consists of two pumps, corresponding to the right and left side of the natural heart. It pumps blood from the left side and right side simultaneously in a synchronized manner. Each pump of the Realheart TAH consists of an atrium and a ventricle, with a valve cylinder in between. When the valve cylinder moves towards ventricle, the blood pumps out from the ventricle creating the systolic phase. The ventricle fills with blood when the valve cylinder moves towards the atrium creating a diastolic phase. The cardiac output of the Realheart TAH depends on the stroke length of the valve cylinder and the frequency of the movement. The left and right pump regulate cardiac output independently in order to coordinate the left/right flow balance of the circulatory system. Similar to natural heart, Realheart TAH is integrated into the circulatory system, which facilitates the uninterrupted blood flow to the atrium, when it pumps the blood out of the ventricle in pulses. The atrium is constructed with a compliance membrane to avoid blood suction from the veins during the systolic phase.
   Objectives: Pre-vascularized, fibrin-based implants that can be attached to the blood vessels in vivo are a promising solution to faster and more efficient vascularization of implants, to facilitate implant healing and survival. Here, low concentrated (up to 10mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels have been shown to promote tube formation of endothelial cells in co-culture with ASC. However, these fibrin hydrogels are fairly unstable and higher fibrin concentrations are necessary for implant fabrication. We investigated whether higher concentrated (20-40 mg/mL) fibrin hydrogels were suitable for tube formation and if perfusion of the hydrogels could support capillarization of a fibrin-based implant. Methods: Capillary formation of endothelial cells was tested in tube assays using fibrin concentrations of 1-30 mg/ml. Hydrogels were fabricated with cryoprecipitated fibrinogen from blood plasma that had been activated with thrombin. Gels were seeded with EC and ASC co-cultures, supplied with feeding medium containing pro-angiogenic factors, and cultivated for 7 days. Hydrogels with 40 mg/mL fibrin and pre-formed channels were cellularized with EC and ASC and perfused with feeding medium for 10 days under continuous flow. Results: In tube assays, only concentrations of 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL fibrin were suitable for endothelial tube formation, which started after 2 days and peaked after 5 days in culture. Tubes were stable for the total assay duration of 7 days. However, under perfusion, fibrin gels of 40 mg/mL showed an endothelialized pore formation throughout the gel. Discussion: High-concentration fibrin hydrogels can successfully be capillarized by EC-ASC co-cultures and perfusion. In static conditions, only low-concentration fibrin hydrogels are suitable for tube formation. As the next step hydrogels of different concentrations are to be connected to fibrin vascular grafts and perfused as a whole implant construct using a custom-made flow chamber as mechanical support.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of the passage number and glucose concentration on viability of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured in the culture flasks. Methods: The HUVEC were isolated from umbilical veins obtained by Caesarean section. Cells after the 2nd and 7th passage were seeded with density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Glucose concentration in the culture medium was kept constant at the normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) level or was switched every 24 hours from normal to high level or vice versa for 7 or 14 days. The cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) and activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed using the flow cytometry (with propidium iodide, JC1 and DCFDA test, respectively). The glucose uptake and lactate production was also monitored. Microscopic visualization of cells was made after fixation in formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: After 7 days of culturing in medium with normal, high and variable glucose concentration the cell viability was higher respectively by 5%, 4% and 4% in the HUVEC passaged 7 times than in those passaged 2 times. After 14 days the differences were higher and equal to 21%, 21% and 31%, respectively. After 7 days Delta psi m was higher 1.3, 3.2 and 2.6 times in HUVEC after 7th passage than those after 2nd one, which were cultured in medium with the normal, high and variable glucose level, respectively. The glucose uptake and the lactate production were higher after 14 days and similar for all passages. The ROS activity was lower after 14 days of culturing for all cultures. Microscopic visualization of cells did not show any morphological differences. Discussion: The obtained results show that the properties and phenotype of HUVEC after the second passage are closer to the properties and phenotype of native cells. The HUVEC after the 7th passage are better adapted to in vitro conditions deviating from physiological conditions.
   One of the pillars for a more patient oriented healthcare is found in patient individualised medicine. Custom-made implants tailored to the individual's specific requirements is one of the key elements herein to obtain better outcomes. However, the production of patient individualised implants is nowadays still often related to a high rate of manual processes, causing both high cost and long delivery periods. Technical innovations play a crucial role in introducing these patient individualised therapy options into clinical prac-tice. Advances in medical imaging and the evolution of new production technologies (e.g. additive manufacturing) build the basis for a time and cost effective production of implants of lot size one at industrial-scale level. Combining these aspects with digitalisation leads to the potential of a new era of patient individualised implants and appropriate business models. It is crucial to systematically review and adapt the data management and data processing throughout the entire value chain in order to achieve the goal of a more patient individualised care. Different tools are used to de-fine interfaces, actors, data types throughout the entire process and methods need to be established for the data pro-cessing itself. A digital process chain from diagnosis to the actual delivery of a custom-made implant to the hospital including the manufacturing process is established. The underlying principles and assumptions used are exemplarily shown. The digital process chain is used to pave the way from science into a successful business model and company, in order to introduce these patient individualised implants to achieve a better patient care. The use of technical and medical progresses in combination with digitalisation is used to obtain a new generation of patient individualised implants. The way from science to start-up within this field is presented.
   Objectives: There are currently no available noninvasive methods that allow for the simultaneous and reliable measure of cardiac output (CO) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the arterial tree. Both of those indices are important biomarkers of cardiovascular status. Methods: Radial pressure profiles were recorded using applanation tonometry in a group of healthy subjects (N=18) and hemodialysis patients (N=30). Recorded pulse waves were used to estimate patient-specific parameters of the mathematical model describing the blood flow in the system of 55 major arteries. Calibration of the model with patient data allowed to calculate patient-specific CO and PWV between any two points in the arterial tree. In all of the patients and healthy subjects we performed additional measurements of PWV using ECG gated applanation tonometry at two arterial sites (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical) and CO using bioimpedance cardiography (PhysioFlow, Manatec Biomedical). Results: The model was able to reproduce all of the recorded pressure profiles with high accuracy (average relative error < 10%). Model-estimated PWV highly correlated with the one measured using SphygmoCor device (R = 0.75, p-value < 0.001). Model-predicted CO also correlated with the one measured by the bioimpedance cardiography, but at a lower level (R = 0.52, p-value <0.001). Discussion: Our study demonstrates that coupling a mathematical model with a single peripheral pressure profile has the potential to provide information about cardiovascular state that was previously only available when using more complicated methods.
   Objectives: The purpose of this work is the study of biocompatibility for samples of three-dimensional cellular and tissue engineering constructions for layer-by-layer repair of tissues of heart and blood vessels. Samples components are albumin, collagen and chitosan as matrices and carbon nanotubes as reinforcement. Three-dimensional structures are formed in layers by laser printing. Methods: The biocompatibility of the samples and layers of their components was evaluated after their incubation with endothelial cells for 72 hours. Cell morphology was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and quantitative analysis was performed using MTT-test and real-time cell analysis by means of electrical impedance monitoring. For in vivo studies, samples were implanted in breasts of laboratory birds. Results: It has been established that the layer consisting of albumin and nanotubes supports proliferation of cells the most. Moreover, all layers have surface properties that provide cell adhesion. Real-time cell analysis showed improved cell proliferation compared to control during the entire incubation time, however the greatest differences were observed after 25 hours of incubation. The morphology of the cells on the samples corresponds to the morphology of the control cells. With implantation of samples in experimental animals, the absence of their toxicity was observed. Discussion: Samples of three-dimensional cellular and tissue-engineering structures are biocompatible because of characteristics of their components and suitable surface structure. The obtained samples can be used to repair damages in cardiovascular system. Due to the method of laser printing, samples can be made in any form, taking into account the features of the damaged area of tissues.
   Objectives: The blood flow rate is the only parameter that can be controlled during the operation of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator that significantly influences the gas exchange rate. Due to anatomical size restrictions, the catheter is of limited size and the tight packaging does not allow for placement of a dedicated flow rate sensor. Therefore, for a flow rate control system, the correct estimation of the blood flow rate is essential. In this work, a system specific flow rate estimation method is presented based on motor current and motor speed measurements. Methods: A training data set of motor current - I and rotational speed - omega, as well as volumetric flow rate - Q were recorded in an in-vitro model of the intracorporeal membrane oxygenator. A 40/60 water/glycerol mixture was used to approximate the dynamic properties of blood. The rotational speed of the motor was varied in a range of 10000 to 30000 RPM. For each motor speed, the hydraulic resistance of the system was varied with a throttle resulting in different flow rate values. Additionally, a test data set was acquired consisting of different rotational speed, hydraulic resistance, and flow rate triplets. The I, omega and Q training data was used to construct a fitting surface of the type Q(I, omega) by a regularized cubic spline least-squares approximation method. The surface was defined in a grid of 591x591 points with Imin=-70 mA, Imax=520 mA, omega min=500 RPM, omega max=30000 RPM. The test set of I - omega pairs was then used to predict Q by means of a nearest neighbor search in the modeled surface. Results: A correlation coefficient of r=0.96 was achieved between the estimated and measured flow rates of the water/glycerol mixture. Discussion: The strong correlation between estimated and measured flow rate suggests that sensorless flow rate control is possible.
   Objectives: Developing new bioinks that are able to meet the crucial requirements for 3D bioprinting of different tissues has emerged recently as an important topic in the field of biomaterials. In this work, linear chains of hyaluronic acid (HA) were hydrophobically modified using hexadecyl short chains. The rheological properties as well as the 3D printability were investigated. Methods: HA of Mw = 76.6 kDa was hydrophobically modified by conjugation of parts of its primary hydroxyl groups with hexadecyl chains in two steps. The ratio of substitution was determined using 1HNMR spectroscopy. Two different hydrogels were prepared at polymer concentration of 0.4 and 1.6 wt%. The rheological properties of both hydrogels were investigated using continuous flow experiment and cyclic strain time sweep experiment. Furthermore, the 3D printability of the hydrogels was studied using an extrusion-based 3D printer. Results: 1H NMR spectrum of the new product revealed that the substitution ratio was 40 mol%. Furthermore, the modified polymer was able to form sable hydrogels at both polymer concentrations whereas unmodified HA was unable to form hydrogel at the same concentrations. The rheological experiments showed decreasing of hydrogels viscosity by increasing the shearing rate which points toward a shear thinning property. Both hydrogels showed sharp decreases in the storage moduli upon applying high strains. The hydrogel prepared using 2.6 wt% of the modified polymer showed, however, higher shape-fidelity for 3D printing compared to hydrogel at polymer concentration of 0.4 wt%. Discussion: Hydrophobic modification of HA using relatively short alkyl chains enables physical crosslinking between polymer chains to produce biocompatible and 3D-printable hydrogel using low concentration of modified polymer. The rheological properties suggest their suitability as ink for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting
   Objectives: High resolution imaging of living cells is impaired by artefacts introduced by chemical fixation and by the rapid movement of molecules during live cell imaging. We have therefore developed tools to cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope and image them by high- and super-resolution microscopy. However, the developed equipment is also applicable to investigate the process of cryopreservation. Methods: We have developed two different microscope cryo-stages that allow for continuous observation on the fluorescence microscope. One stage allows for relatively slow controlled cooling (<50 degrees C/min) and warming (<150 degrees C/min) of cells. It allows for medium exchange during cooling and warming and thus for change of concentration of cryoprotective agents. Due to the design of this microscope stage, oil immersion objectives can be used down to at least -45 degrees C. The second stage is designed to ultra-rapidly cool cells with >10000 degrees C/s to temperatures Results: We established a protocol to reversibly cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope stage. This permits to image physiological processes in the same living cells with practically unlimited acquisition time at consecutive points in time. This allowed for super-resolution imaging and microspectroscopy measurements, which were impeded at physiological temperatures, because of the dynamics of cellular molecules. The development of a device to ultra-rapidly cryo-arrest living cells on a microscope under continuous observation allowed for the investigation of cells, which have been cryo-arrested/vitrified within Discussion: The presented cryo-fixations methods enable a more precise measurement of molecular patterns and thus a better understanding of molecular organization in cells under physiological conditions. The developed microscopy stages should however also enable high- and super-resolution fluorescence imaging of molecular processes in cells during the process of cryopreservation.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to provide a general overview of the design challenges in the wireless powering of artificial organs, to develop a general design strategy for inductive powering units (IPU), and to design a prototype IPU for mid-power application with high-stable output characteristic. Methods: Artificial organs can benefit greatly from inductive wireless powering, but there are several major design challenges which must be overcome. The high energy transfer efficiency must be ensured. The IPU must tolerate coils misalignments. Tissue overheating must be avoided. Biocompatible materials must be used. Size and weight restrictions must be taken into account. Finally, patient body specifics should be considered. We have developed a new general design strategy in which all mentioned problems are addressed. The main feature is that we simultaneously optimize the inductive link and the schematics of the transmitter and the receiver and take the body specific elements (the thickness of the skin and the fat layer) into account. We have developed strictly formal procedures which can be implemented using software in computer-aided design procedures. Results: In order to test and verify our approach we have designed a prototype IPU. The design goal was set as follows: IPU must ensure output power in the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis 0.55 W for the axial distance between the coils in the range 10 horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral misalignments up to 20 mm. The design goal was achieved. Several coil couples were used to adjust optimal energy transfer distance to the expected implantation depth. Measurements were performed in the air as well as with the samples of "skin-fat" biological objects were performed. Discussion: We have developed and tested design strategy for biomedical IPU which can provide reliable design adjusted to the various requirements and the specific of the patient's body.
   Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) and HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA) clinically revealed a significantly different thrombogenic profile. In detail, while the HM3 has abated incidence of pump thrombosis, it was not associated with reduced stroke incidence. We numerically characterized and compared prothrombotic flow characteristics of the two pumps to provide mechanistic insights into observed clinical outcomes. Methods: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to evaluate flow fields associated with periodic speed modulation in the two pumps (the artificial pulse for the HM3 and the Lavare cycle for the HVAD). One-way coupling to a lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system was employed to account for physiologic boundary conditions. Results were compared to baseline simulations with constant pressure head and rotor speed to comprehensively evaluate geometrical and speed modulation effects. Analysis of the thrombogenic potential was based on calculation of: i) a specific platelet activation marker, the Platelet Activity State (PAS), using time course of viscous and Reynolds stress computed on platelet trajectories probed using Lagrangian particle tracking, ii) scalar washout, iii) volumes of flow stagnation, and iv) wall shear stress patterns. Results: The HM3 and HVAD showed different PAS distribution. Speed modulation was associated with increased sum of viscous and Reynolds stresses and PAS magnitude. Analysis of temporal and spatial gradients of the shear stress histories calculated on platelet trajectories, volumes of stagnation, and wall shear stresses allowed identification of geometrical and operating parameters that might contribute to pump thrombogenicity and pump washout Discussion: We compared prothrombotic fluid dynamic features of the HM3 and HVAD under realistic dynamic operating conditions. Our results provide a "numerical rationale" for the observed clinical outcomes.
   Objectives: Over time left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have become an alternative to heart transplantation because of enormous technical development and miniaturization. Implantation of these systems has been proven to lead to considerably improved survival, with an increase in quality of life. Following implantation, most patients display a considerable improvement in physical capacity, measured according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, even though exercise tolerance levels following the implantation of an LVAD are still considerably restricted. Methods: Current state of scientific knowledge with respect to the physical capacity of patients with terminal heart failure after LVAD implantation is described at rest and during exercise. The significance of new diagnostic tools, such as the non-invasive inert gas rebreathing method for measurement of cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2) in assessment of the performance of LVAD patients is discussed. Results: Pump flow across the LVAD can be increased to a certain degree during exercise and normal everyday activities via two mechanisms: exercise-dependent tachycardia and increase of enddiastolic pressure in the left ventricle in conjunction with increased preloading. The share of the native left ventricle in systemic perfusion can also increase during exercise. Here, left-ventricular pressure exceeds systemic blood pressure and the aortic valve opens. The contractile reserve of the myocardium does, of course, play a crucial role. Discussion: Ultimately, the cardiopulmonary capacity of LVAD patients is restricted to a higher degree during exercise, even after implantation. Larger studies are required to clarify the extent to which longer-term physical exercise training after discharge from rehabilitation and/or an increase in the number of pump rotations can lead to increased physical capacity in LVAD patients.
   Objectives: The epidemiology of heart failure (HF) is a rising medical burden with an estimated growing rate of 46% from 2012 to 2030. Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) and minimally invasive techniques are nowadays key therapies to guarantee optimal treatments for each HF patient. So far, clinical experience with minimally-invasive LVAD surgery showed promising short-term results. The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term results of the first series of patients who received minimally-invasive LVAD surgery at our institution. Methods: We reviewed the short and long term outcomes of 111 end-stage HF patients who received an LVAD implantation (HVAD, HeartWare, Medtronic, USA) at our institution between 2011 and 2014. All patients underwent an upper hemisternotomy and left-sided anterolateral thoracotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: Between 2011 and 2014, 111 minimally-invasive LVAD implantations were performed at our institution (78% male, 22% female; mean age 52 +/- 4; dilated cardiomyopathy 42.6%; ischaemic cardiomyopathy 44.4%, other aetiologies 13%). Postoperative bleeding incidence was 9.6% leading to a low amount of applied packed red blood cells (mean: 4.9 rbc), short ICU stay (mean 9.3 days), and a low incidence of right heart failure (4.6%). Thirty-day mortality was 5.2%, 90-day mortality 9.0% and 1-year survival 88%. Long-term follow-up (median 6.4 years) demonstrated a mortality of 51,4%, a transplant rate of 16.4%, and an explant rate of 1,7%. 15.8% of patients underwent pump exchange and 30,3% of patients had still an ongoing LVAD therapy at the time of follow-up. Discussion: Minimally-invasive LVAD implantations are proven to be safe and associated with a lower perioperative complication and mortality rate. By using an upper hemisternotomy with an anterolateral thoracotomy, the intra-hospital outcomes showed promising results impacting also the long-term follow-up which presented an excellent percentage of ongoing LVAD therapies.
   Objectives: Quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) provides fast and label-free analysis of living cells by minimized interaction with the sample. The analysis of QPM images enables the determination of morphological cell parameters like cell thickness and elongation and facilitates single cell tracking for migration analysis. Methods: To demonstrate the potential of QPM in determining the metastatic potential of cells, we have developed a fully automated QPM system utilizing digital holographic microscopy (DHM) in an off-axis Mach-Zehnder configuration. Different pancreatic tumor cell lines, beating heart cells, white blood cells and in vitro toxicology models were analyzed for refraction index, cell volume, cell area, dry mass and cell morphology dependent processes. Results: The morphological analysis of the different cell lines via QPM in combination with image segmentation-based evaluation of the retrieved quantitative phase images showed that QPI could identify and quantify cell types and cellular processes by cell specific properties as cell proliferation, cell death, 3D cell migration or cell height. E. g. cells with a high metastatic potential had a lower cell thickness and a higher elongation than cells with a low metastatic potential. Moreover, computer assisted tracking of single cells showed that highly metastatic cells covered a longer distance and had a higher motility compared to cells with a low metastatic potential. Also white blood cell types and disease or drug induced morphological blood cell alterations could be separated. Discussion: In summary, the multi-functional potential of QPM in various cell biological applications as cancer cell or stem cell research, toxicological and pharmacological screenings and cell quality control represents a promising new approach for a fast and label free phenotyping of different cell types and cellular processes. QPM meets the growing interest in label-free, optical techniques minimizing samples interaction.
   Objectives: Severe life-threatening thrombocytopenia may be caused by exceptionally wide range of clinical conditions. Currently, donor platelet (PLT) transfusion is the only efficient clinical approach to successfully treat thrombocytopenia. However, PLT transfusion is challenged by adverse immune responses and is limited the short shelf life of donated material. Previously, we showed the feasibility to generate iPSC-derived MKs in a large scale, which can be used as an alternative to conventional PLT transfusion. However, success of this perspective therapeutic approach requires efficient biobanking technologies that would allow long-term storage and accumulation of MKs in clinically sufficient amounts. In this study, we aimed at the development of an optimal biobanking strategies for the preservation of iPSC-derived MKs. Methods: Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and propane-1,2-diol (PD) were evaluated for their cryoprotective efficiency in iPSC-derived MKs. Comprehensive phenotypic characterization of MKs before and after cryopreservation was performed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Capability of cryopreserved MKs to form proPLTs and release functional PLTs has been tested in vitro. Transfusion into animal model has been performed to evaluate capability of MKs to release PLTs in vivo. Results and Discussion: Application of developed cryopreservation procedures allowed recovery of over 80% of iPSC-derived MKs cryopreserved with Me2SO and PD. Recovered cell populations expressed typical MK markers, including CD41, CD61, and CD42a and showed high polyploidy. Moreover, cryopreserved MKs showed the capability to form proPLTs and release PLTs in vitro as well as in vivo after transfusion in animal model. Present findings propose efficient clinically relevant biobanking strategies necessary for progress in MK-based regenerative and replacement approaches.
   Objectives: Adverse events due to flow-induced blood damage remain a serious problem for blood pumps as cardiac support systems. The numerical prediction of blood damage via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a helpful tool for the design and optimization of reliable pumps. Blood damage prediction models primarily are based on the acting shear stresses, which are calculated by solving the Navier-Stokes equations on computational grids. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of the spatial discretization and the associated discretization error on the shear stress calculation in a blood pump in comparison to other important flow quantities like the pressure head of the pump. Methods: CFD analysis using seven Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations were performed. Two simple stress calculation indicators were applied to estimate the influence of the discretization on the results using an approach to calculate numerical uncertainties, which indicates discretization errors. Results: For the finest grid with 19 million elements, numerical uncertainties up to 20 % for shear stresses were determined, while the pressure heads show smaller uncertainties with a maximum of 4.8 %. Discussion: No grid-independent solution for velocity gradient-dependent variables could be obtained on a grid size that is comparable to mesh sizes in state-of-the-art blood pump studies. It can be concluded that the grid size has a major influence on the shear stress calculation, and therefore the potential blood damage prediction, and that the quantification of this error should always be taken into account.
   Objectives: The piezoelectric effect of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a promising property to be considered when controlling the diffusion of ions through membranes. This study examines the impact of different solvents and their ratios on the piezoelectric beta-phase of PVDF and on the diffusion rates of fiber membranes. Methods: Fiber mats were polarized via electrospinning using 20w% PVDF solutions with solvent mixtures of dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylacetamide (DMAc) as first solvent and acetone or methyl acetate (MeOAc) as second solvent in different ratios. Conversion of non-polar alpha-phase into polar beta-phase was evaluated via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Diffusion experiments were performed by measuring changes in conductivity of deionized water (1.5 mu S/cm) for 150min under static and cyclic loading conditions. Results: Polymer solutions showed a non-Newtonian behavior. An increasing acetone ratio led to decreasing densities in PVDF solutions. Densities remained unchanged for all MeOAc ratios. FTIR results for MeOAc-solubilized PVDF fiber mats showed lower intensity of alpha-phase peaks at 762cm(-1) as compared to acetone solubilized ones. The intensity of the characteristic 840cm(-1) polar beta-phase peak rose with a higher ratio of the second solvent. Diffusion experiments with piezoelectric PVDF membranes (n=5) inhibited sodium chloride diffusion under static conditions (67 mu S/cm) while induction of the direct piezoelectric effect allowed for increased diffusion (533 mu S/cm). Discussion: Solvent properties and ratios influence the intrinsic properties of PVDF solutions for electrospinning and consequently affect beta-phase conversion. Especially, MeOAc in combination with DMF or DMAc has a positive effect on piezoelectric beta-phase conversion. With suitable process parameters, piezoelectric fiber mats can be produced for active filter membranes. Ongoing experiments aim to investigate their molecular weight cut-off properties.
   Objectives: A cochlear implant (CI) is an auditory neuroprosthesis used to restore hearing in deaf and profoundly deaf patients. It features an electrode array (EA) which needs to be inserted into the inner ear (cochlea) to enable electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Spatial proximity of the EA and the nerve fibers is considered beneficial. This requires a shape change of the initially straight EA to enclose the inner wall of the spiral-shaped inner ear after implantation. Thin wires made of Nitinol-a shape memory alloy (SMA)-are investigated regarding their applicability as embedded actuators to implement a shape change. Methods: Nitinol wires ( null 100 mu m) have been trained to a spiral shape which was derived from cross-sectional images of a human specimen as an exemplary adaption to a specific cochlea geometry. Ten different variations of thermomechanical processing were applied by the supplier (G.RAU GmbH & Co. KG) to tailor the shape memory effect to the application specific requirements. In order to determine the resulting transformation temperatures (AS, AF) a bend and free recovery (BFR) test suitable for curved wires was developed and utilized. Results: It is possible to design and fabricate spiral-shaped SMA wires which fit to a specific cochlea shape. The developed BFR test setup allows for measuring the thermomechanical properties of these actuators in an application oriented manner. This provides slightly higher but more realistic measures for AS and AF compared to differential scanning calorimetry. Discussion: A complete design, manufacturing and validation process for thin spiral shape memory wires could be established. The next step is to integrate these wires into an EA and perform BFR measurements again as it is known that external forces due to stiffness of the EA alter the transformation temperatures.
   Objectives: The purpose of the work is to develop a theoretical basis for determining the thickness of the laminar boundary layer in the nasal cavity during respiration. Methods: Methods for obtaining basic scientific and practical results are based on the general principles of theoretical physics and aerodynamics in order to determine the laminar boundary layer of air flow in the upper respiratory tract. Results: Using the aerodynamic approach to the study of respiratory and olfactory disorders revealed that the thickness of the laminar boundary layer decreases with decreasing equivalent diameter of the nasal cavity and with increasing Reynolds number, which characterizes the degree of turbulence in the air flow. Typical values of the thickness of the laminar boundary layer are in the range of 0.2-0.05 mm, depending on the mode of nasal breathing and the configuration of the nasal cavity. The data obtained characterizes the effect of airflow on the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity: if the heterogeneity of the mucosal surface extends beyond the boundary of the laminar boundary layer, then such portions of the nasal cavity are exposed to turbulent flow, which leads to overdrying. The size of the heterogeneities of the mucosa is determined by tomographic data during their processing at the sub-pixel level, which allows for the investigation of the effect of the intensity of the boundary elements of the walls of the nasal passages. Discussion: A model of the distribution of airflow velocities in the nasal cavity in the turbulent mode is proposed; it has a logarithmic or power profile cross section, and within the laminar boundary layer the air velocity increases linearly to almost the max value. The current air velocity in the cross sections amounted to 5-7 m/s. The feature of the developed method is transitioned to hydraulic diameter, which takes into account complex configuration of the nasal cavity, as well as an anatomically narrow area - the olfactory slit.
   Objectives: Bioengineering of elements of the musculo-skeletal system is rich in studies concerning bone reconstruction. Among them, the culture of cells on a osteogenic electrospun scaffold under dynamic conditions is an interesting option. However, one should also consider the reconstruction of tendon and muscle finally mimicking a continuum from bone to muscle. Methods: Poly-caprolactone (PCL) 10% was electrospun on a rotating collector whose velocity varied to get random or aligned nanofibers. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and C2C12 cells were respectively seeded on the materials. Mechanical or electrical stresses were applied to the biohybrid scaffolds to differentiate cells towards tendon's or muscle's phenotypes, in the absence any specific biochemical factors. Results: After 2 weeks of culture under dynamic stretching (1Hz, 4% strain for an hour followed by 11h of rest), BMSCs were found to align in the stretching direction, presented increased levels of tenomodulin and neosynthetized collagen, compared to static conditions. C2C12 differentiation until aligned myotubes stage was more difficult to achieve. We proposed to add a PEG microstructure to guide cell growth. Combined to electrical stimulation, it led to the cells fusion into very long myotubes hosting many nuclei, as expected. Discussion: In this study, we managed to grow two different types of cells and generate their differentiation towards tendon and muscle lineage, in the absence of any differentiation factors. The next step is to implement the co-culture on different areas of the same electrospun scaffold, to let the cells proliferate and study the events occurring at the junction.
   Objectives: Alarm fatigue is a safety and quality problem where exposure to high rates of clinical alarms results in desensitization leading to cognitive bias or slowed response to alarms. One reason for alarm fatigue is false pressure alarms during extracorporeal blood therapies. It is clear that current machine algorithms based on simple threshold monitoring must be replaced by intelligent algorithms that avoid any false positive alarm. Methods: Detailed analysis of arterial pressure, venous pressure, transmembrane pressure, ultrafiltration rate and relative blood volume during hemodialysis was performed using a patient data base. Main causes of pressure alarms were identified, analysed and replicated during simulated hemodialysis therapies with a FMC 4008 hemodialysis device and a patient simulator. Results: Data analysis shows clear evidence that even slowly drifting adaptive baseline alarms which are currently in use lead to false positive alarms with a high probability during nearly every treatment. Pressure variations which are induced by local flow and blood viscosity changes can be identified reliably by use of algorithms based on pattern recognition. Pressure variations from patient movements and changes in blood pressure show a different pattern that can be used to distinguish between true alarm events and false positive events. Discussion: For 25 years, it has been known that alarm systems which monitor whether a threshold value is exceeded have a rate of false alarms of 77-99,5% depending on the physiologic parameter monitored (Wiklund et al., 1994). New adaptive algorithms based on pattern recognition principles help to combine both maximum patient safety and avoidance of false positive pressure alarms.
   Objectives: In vivo tissue engineered vascular tissues "Biotubes" constructed in the subcutaneous spaces of the recipients exhibited superior functions. However, since the formation of the vascular tissues depends on the recipient conditions, chemical pretreatments such as dehydration by ethanol (ET) or crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) were attempted to improve their initial mechanical durability. Last year, we reported that ET and GA increased the burst pressure of the tissues and did not affect their suture retention strength. This year, we measured 3 parameters of mechanical properties: ultimate tensile strength (UTS), ultimate strain (%) and Young's modulus. Methods: Tubular tissues (ID: 5 mm) constructed in the subcutaneous tissues of beagle dogs (4 weeks, n=3) were separated to the 3 groups, raw tissue group with no treatments (RAW), that under dehydration with 70% ET (ET) for 10 min and crosslinking with 0.6% GA (GA) for 10 min. We measured 3 parameters shown above, by tissue ringlet pull test. Results: There were no significant differences in UTS (RAW: 3.765 +/- 0.662 MPa, ET: 4.330 +/- 0.619 MPa, GA: 3.763 +/- 0.438 MPa, p=0.409) or ultimate strain (RAW: 30.15 +/- 1.60 %, ET: 41.22 +/- 6.11 %, GA: 37.73 +/- 4.36 %, p=0.209) between the 3 groups. Young's modulus of ET group was significantly higher among the 3 groups (RAW: 5.41 +/- 1.16 MPa, ET: 12.28 +/- 2.55 MPa, GA: 7.65 +/- 1.18 MPa, p= 0.0289). Discussion: Short period of chemical treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to control the mechanical properties of in vivo tissue engineered vascular tissues to produce the ideal grafts in mechanical aspects.
   Objectives: Stent graft development is one of the most important topics for countries with a large number of elderly people. However, very little research has been carried out using model circulation of the aortic dissection. Quantitative evaluation and development have been difficult, because there was no model. Methods: In this study, a fluid dynamical circuit model circulation simulating the left heart circulation of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was developed with a pulsatile blood pump. Various shapes of the inflow side and outflow side for the pseudo lumen were used in the experimental series. Furthermore, an animal model of the dissecting aneurysm was developed using a mechanical dissecting method and flow patterns of the animal aortas with the model dissecting aneurysm, after the ethical committee's approval. Flow and pressure pattern time series data was recorded in the digital recorder and a quantitative evaluation was carried out. Results: Flow of the true lumen and pseudo lumen was divided with a thin membrane. Various amounts of the flow and pressure was observed and recorded. Membrane of the dissecting aortic aneurysm was simulated with rubber sheet. After the insertion of the aortic stent, the shapes of the flow and pressure pattern were altered. Animal experiments to develop the dissecting aneurysm were difficult. Firstly the aorta of the goats was removed, and then the dissecting aneurysm was to be constructed by the detachment of the tunica media of the aortic wall. Flow pattern of the experimental Aorta was recorded. Discussion: Quantitative evaluation of the Aortic Stent expanding performance and pressure and flow pattern in the true and pseudo lumen had been observed in the mock circulation loop. Furthermore, animal model of the dissecting aorta will be useful material for the development of the stent graft in the near future.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to investigate the performance of the RealHeart (TM)psi total artificial heart (TAH) with a hybrid cardiac simulator (HCS). Methods: The HCS, developed at the Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, is a computational-hydraulic model of the cardiovascular system. Four hydro-numerical interfaces reproduced the pressure/flow profiles of atria, pulmonary artery, and aorta hydraulically, while the rest of the circulation was numerical. The TAH was connected accordingly. The TAH is a pulsatile 4-chamber device whose left and right sides can operate independently, by changing pulse rate (PR) and stroke length (SL). The TAH was tested on the HCS at low/medium operating points: PR 60/80/100/120 bpm; SL 20/22/24/26 mm; systole duration ratio 0.4 of the TAH cycle. Systemic resistance was changed between 0.8 and 1.2 mmHg/(ml/s), pulmonary resistance was changed between 0.1 and 0.2 mmHg/(ml/s). Systemic and pulmonary compliances were set to 1.4 ml/mmHg. Results: The independent tuning of PR and SL permits fine regulation the TAH flow on the left and right sides. As an example, for a peripheral resistance of 1.0 mmHg/(ml/s) the flow ranged from 2.7 l/min (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 7.0 l/min (PS=120,SL=26mm). For the investigated PRs and SLs, power consumption on the left pump ranged between 1.3 and 10.0 Watts and on the right pump between 0.9 and 6.0 Watts. The TAH provides a pulsatile flow, whose waveform depends on the SL and systole duration. This induced a pressure pulsatility ranging from 10mmHg (PR=60,SL=20mm) to 38 mmHg (PR=120,SL=26mm) in both the aorta and pulmonary artery. Discussion: The HCS is a flexible test bench to evaluate the TAH performance in different hemodynamic conditions. The tuning of PR and SL on the left and right side of the TAH, independently, offers flexibility in regulating cardiac output and in managing the left/right flow balance. Power consumption is in the range suitable for clinical applications.
   Objectives: In case of chronic mechanical circulatory support, it is highly desirable to fully understand the interaction between the beating left ventricle and the VAD in order to potentially reduce adverse events. Thus, we took the VAD's perspective and investigated the flow inside a VAD in an advanced development status during the time course of a heartbeat. Methods: The study is conducted with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applying realistic pressure boundary conditions for left ventricular and arterial pressure and the results are compared to results produced with an established, active mock circulation loop. Due to the high resolution in time and space and the use of sliding mesh interfaces, local flow phenomena during different phases of systole and diastole are unmasked. The effects of inertia in the pump and cannulae become evident, which are not modeled in more traditional VAD flow simulations with steady-state boundary conditions. Results: The results show that hysteresis effects due to inertia are quantitatively of high importance. The hysteresis curves of the VAD operational point obtained experimentally and numerically correlate well. Moreover, the results show that a VAD design for a highly pulsed flow can lead to a situation, where almost no remaining stagnation zones, as quantified with a numerical stagnation index, exist during a heartbeat. Discussion: Despite increased computational costs, highly resolved CFD simulations in time and space with realistic time-varying boundary conditions are a powerful tool to increase understanding of the interaction of the mechanically supported circulation and the device itself. This enabled a verification of a VAD design with low to almost non-existing flow stagnation at constant rotational speed. This finding correlates well with the fact that the VAD does not require any anticoagulation in chronic animal trial testing lasting weeks to months.
   Objectives: The friction properties for the contact between contact lenses and the eyelid are the focus of current research in order to optimize the wearing comfort. The tribological system consisting of contact lense, eyelid and tear fluid should be considered. Suitable measurement conditions must be used for the examinations. Methods: In this research the nano- and microtribological friction properties of hard and soft (hydrogel) contact lenses were investigated. The friction conditions were investigated by nano scratch test; moreover, a nanotribometer was used to evaluate the frictional properties during sliding on the lenses. Contact lens fluid was applied as lubricant for both cases. Results: The friction coefficients of hard contact lenses and hydrogel lenses were detected for a range of speeds and loads. It was possible to examine the differences of the both contact lenses in detail. For the nano scratch and friction tests, there is a dependency of speed and normal force. Discussion: In case of nano-scratch tests, the frictional properties were investigated wile ploughing. This case shows the elastic- and plastic material properties besides the friction. In the case of the frictional tests, the measuring tip slides without ploughing. Due to the lubrication conditions, the soft hydrogel lenses feature a much lower friction coefficient. In case of the hard contact lenses, the coefficient of friction is comparable to the nano scratch test, as there is no lubrication film between both measuring tips and the contact lens. For further work it is mandatory to work under standazdized measurement conditions.
   Objectives: Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) show an increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity mainly due to the accumulation of protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Dialysis therapies have been optimized for the removal of low-molecular weight water-soluble and unbound uremic retention solutes, but not for protein-bound uremic retention solutes. Therefore, there is a strong need to increase the portion of unbound fractions in order to increase the clearance for these uremic toxins. Methods: We developed dialysis techniques where the protein-bound uremic retention solutes are removed more efficiently under high ionic strength or high-frequent electric fields. The protein integrity of proteins and enzymatic activities were analysed. Results: The protein-bound fraction of phenylacetic acid, indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate was significantly decreased by using high ionic strength or high-frequent electric fields Discussion: Although protein-bound uremic retention solutes have a major impact on the morbidity and mortality of CKD patients, the clearance of these solutes by conventional extracorporeal therapies is low until now. These uremic toxins bind to plasma proteins with a molecular weight greater than the cut-off of dialysis membranes and therefore conventional dialysis therapies do not sufficiently remove protein-bound uremic toxins. Disruption of association with protein and uremic solute is one possibility to significantly improve the removal of protein-bound uremic toxins. Therefore, we developed approaches for an increased release protein-bound uremic retention solutes from their protein-binding resulting in an increased clearance. Conclusion: Improvements of therapies for CKD patients are essential. Especial the consideration of removing hydrophobic protein-bound uremic toxins via new methods like application of high-electric fields or increased ionic strength is a further progress
   Objectives: Tissue decellularization is one of the novel techniques in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for obtaining extracellular matrix, which doesn't preserve mechanical properties of native tissue. Modified by the extracellular matrix, silk fibroin scaffolds can combine high biocompatibility and suitable mechanical properties. Methods: Wistar rats were used as liver donors. Decellularization of liver tissue was performed by sequential incubation with three solutions of 0,1% SDS containing Triton X-100 in the following concentrations: 1%, 2% and 3%. Livers were ground in liquid nitrogen and a certain fraction of microparticles was separated by precipitation and centrifugation. Silk fibroin scaffolds were prepared by a casting method using water as a solvent. Microparticle suspension was blended with fibroin solution before film preparation. Scaffold structure was investigated by scanning probe nanotomography (SPM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cytotoxicity of scaffolds, cell adhesion and proliferation were evaluated. Modified scaffolds were used as wound coatings in a full-thickness skin wound model. Results: Microparticles with a size less than 5 mu m were prepared from decellularized liver tissue. Modified silk fibroin scaffolds were obtained. Sinuous and rough topography of the obtained matrix was shown. The produced scaffolds did not show cytotoxic effect. The cells adhesion was significantly higher on scaffolds modified with decellularized liver tissue microparticles in comparison with non-modified scaffolds. Modified silk fibroin scaffolds promoted skin wound regeneration by 30% in comparison with non-modified scaffolds. Discussion: Regenerative potential of extracellular matrix as microparticles was shown. Decellularization of organs and tissues may be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for increasing the biocompatibility of the artificial grafts.
   Hemodialysis is an important therapy for End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients if a donor kidney is not available. During four hours of conventional therapy, three times a week, mainly small water-soluble toxins and a limited number of middle molecules are effectively removed from the patients' blood [1]. Besides, the therapy is non-continuous, causing large fluctuations in water balance and uremic waste, potassium and phosphate. Therefore, in recent years, many developments are focussed on longer treatment times, such as, nocturnal dialysis or application of a portable or wearable artificial kidney (PAK or WAK respectively). The continuous therapy outside the hospital requires application of membranes with long-term selectivity, fouling resistance and blood compatibility as well as demands reduced amount of water. In fact, for WAK, a small volume of spent dialysate should be continuously regenerated and reused. In this lecture, we will discuss all these important issues, including:
   Strategies for achieving endotoxin-free dialysate since the continuous recirculation of the dialysate for prolonged time demands additional efforts to avoid microbial contamination, without extra water consumption and without affecting the overall weight of the system. Strategies for achieving dialysate regeneration and especially urea removal since its daily molar production is higher than that of other waste solutes.
   Objectives: Ventricular assist devices are a commonly used therapy for end stage heart failure patients. Pump thrombosis is one of the most common problems in patients supported by an LVAD. Two types of thrombus can be distinguished: white thrombi and red thrombi. The only available option to combat a PT is a lysis therapy or a pump exchange. The objective of the presented study is to develop a relevant white pump thrombus model to promote development of these concepts. Methods: We developed an in vitro mock circulation system. The artificial blood circulation is provided by a HVAD. The HVAD pumps 80ml of human blood through the silicone loop. Parameters for inducing the white thrombus are high shear stress (4000 revolutions per minute), a rougher surface of the rotor, and an added activator of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. After two hours, the HVAD-system was checked for a white thrombus. Generated thrombi were stored for subsequent analysis (scanning electron microscopy and mechanical stability). Results: Thrombus generation was reproducible in number and geometry. After ten test runs, 23 thrombi were detected. All these generated thrombi had a minimal size of 12 mm(2). The developed thrombi are very similar in structure compared to white patient thrombi explanted in clinic. The scanning electron microscope showed a fibrin net on the surface of all tested thrombi (n=5). All tested thrombi samples (n=5) resist high strength (max. 1.029 MPa) in compression tests, which is typical for white PT. Discussion: The size of the thrombus should be increased for special investigational needs. A protocol was developed for reproducible and reliable production of white, shear induced thrombi for lysis therapy investigations. In addition, the similarity (biological structure, mechanical stability) to explanted patient thrombi was shown. However, additional analyses should be performed for further characterization of the artificial thrombi.
   Patient-specific anatomies can be reconstructed with a precision of approximately 0.5mm, using state of the art imaging modalities. This refers both to hard and soft tissues, hence with applications in clinical domains such as orthopedics, dentistry, cardiovascular surgery. Datamining techniques such as statistical shape modeling support the generation of biofidelic computer models. However, these models have to be fed with accurate data to reflect not only the geometry but also the material properties, the loading conditions and the interface between implants and bone in case of prosthetic reconstruction. The challenge is to optimize the interface between host tissue and implant in order to achieve maximum long-term functionality, but this optimization is also dependent on the optimization of the interfacing between the implant, the surgeon and the host tissue. Thus also the surgical technique will benefit from engineering support. Biomedical engineering is a key player to achieve this. A good geometric fit between implant and host tissue will ensure optimal initial stability. Patient-specific implants can ensure this stability, incorporating solid and porous structures where needed. Pre-operative computer assisted planning allows to optimize the surgical intervention, incorporating patient-specific biomechanical models to predict the functional outcome of the surgical intervention. And finally, in order to achieve that the pre-operative plan is accurately transferred into the surgical practice, computer assisted surgery enabled by e.g. navigation, robotics of patient-specific surgical instrumentation (guides and implants) can come into play. Key to all state of the art developments in computer assisted surgery is the engineering on anatomy, enabled by multifunctional softwares and 3D printing technologies. Biomechanical modeling allows for patient-specific outcome prediction after surgical interventions and should become a routine practice in patient treatment. Patient specific surgical instrumentation is able to assist in realising the plan with sub-millimeter precision. Finally, quantification of the uncertainties that are inherent to biomechanical modeling is an essential contribution to reliable patient-specific outcome prediction.
   Objectives: Hemodialysis (HD) is a lifesaving therapy in patients with end stage renal disease. Little is known about why life expectancy for these patients is reduced in Europe and USA as compared to Japan. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of the interdialytic weight gain (fluid retention in relation to estimated body weight in %, IDWG) in relation to the dialysis length (hours). Methods: 20 hemodialysis patients performed besides their regular dialyses 1 hemodialysis/week within the frame of the study during a 3 week period. The baseline values and the change during HD of NT-pro-BNP (ProBNP) and Troponin T (TnT) at 180 minutes and pentraxin 3 (PTX) at 30 and 180min were compared with the change in IDWG divided by the hours the patient performed the HD as a marker of speed of ultrafiltration. The PROOF formula used was: [100 x Weight gain between dialysis (kg)]/[estimated body dry weight (kg) x time of HD session (hours)]. Spearmans correlation analysis was used to adjust for eventual outliers. Results: There was a correlation between extent of removal of the IDWG/hours of HD: 1) the baseline values of ProBNP (rho=0.54, p<0.001), TnT (rho=0.37, p=0.004), PTX (rho=0.26, p=0.043) and 2) the change during HD at 30 min of PTX (rho=0.27, p=0.038) and at 180 minutes of ProBNP (rho=0.68, p<0.001) and TnT (rho=0.40, p=0.002). 3) a PROOF breakpoint < 0.63 caused less release of ProBNP (p<0.001). Discussion: The increase in weight between dialyses should be related to the body weight. A larger IDWG gives worse conditions. An increased speed of fluid in relation to body weight removal causes a higher release of cardiac markers indicating a strain and damage to the heart by each HD in contrast to what would be expected. Patients should be advised to limit fluid intake in relation to their body weight and adjust the HD length.
   Objectives: Fish roe is a highly nutritional product with diverse beneficial effects for the human health. This work used sardine (Sardina pilchardus) roe to produce novel delivery systems presenting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods: Methyl-tert-butyl ether extraction method was used to obtain lipid- and water-soluble compound rich phases. The fatty acids profile was analyzed by GC/MS. The identification of the hydrophilic compounds was performed by LC-HRMS. Lipids were used to produce large unilamellar liposomes (LUVs). The hydration of the lipid film was performed with PBS or sardine roe-derived aqueous phase. LUVs were characterized by their size, surface potential and morphology. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was evaluated using L929 cells. Their antioxidant activity was evaluated against different radicals, and their anti-inflammatory activity was assessed in the presence of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Results: GC/MS analyses demonstrated the presence of several fatty acids, such as omega 3 fatty acids. LC-HRMS analyses revealed the presence of numerous bioactive compounds (e.g. essential amino acids and gadusol). LUVs prepared with the aqueous phase presented a higher heterogeneity in terms of size than when they were prepared with buffer. Both LUVs formulations have a negative surface charge and a spherical shape. The extracts presented antioxidant activity against peroxyl, hydroxyl and nitric oxide radicals. Biological assays indicated that the extracts are cytocompatible for the lowest tested concentrations and that they can inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which reveals their anti-inflammatory effect. Discussion: Our sardine roe-derived delivery systems and compounds have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and thus they may be considered as a valid alternative for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.
   Objectives: Engineered skeletal muscle tissues in three-dimensional (3D) cell culture platforms that resemble the muscles complex native structure and organization can be used as in vitro models to study muscle physiology and metabolism. This project allows us to develop a new platform to model muscle diseases (such as myotonic dystrophy 1) in vitro in order to study its response to candidate therapeutics and to better understand disease mechanisms of pathogenesis. To this end, we monitor the secretion of disease-associated biomarker proteins and metabolites. Methods: Here, we present 3D skeletal muscle constructs, fabricated by encapsulating C2C12 cells and patient-derived transdifferentiated skin fibroblasts in a photocrosslinkable Gelatin Methacrylate and Carbolymethylcellulose Methacrylate (GelMA:CMCMA) hydrogel and cryogel scaffold. These scaffolds present a microgrooved topography that promotes cell alignment and differentiation. Electrical stimulation (ES) was then applied to the engineered tissues during cell culture to induce spontaneous contraction and maturation of the sarcomeres. Cell alignment differentiation, and the effect of ES were assessed by calculating the orientation angle and fusion index of immunostained myotubes expressing Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC). Results: We have obtained a new platform to study the evolution of congenital muscle diseases, specifically myotonic dystrophy 1 and evaluate the functional tissues by metabolic and gene expression analysis. Monitor the secretion of biomarkers proteins, metabolites, and the glycolysis pathway of muscle tissues for different drug candidates. Discussion: This platform has been tested with different drugs assays and represent a step toward the goal of producing in vitro drug testing systems for medical and pharmaceutical industry applications. Finally, such "muscle tissue-on-a-chip" devices can be fabricated using patient's own cells as a major step toward personalized medicine.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is the creation and research of properties of tissue-engineering structures by the method of laser structuring a nanocarbon framework in bioorganic matrices. Methods: For the formation of the framework fibers from single-walled carbon nanotubes were used. Aqueous dispersions of nanocarbon fibers and proteins of albumin, collagen and amino sugar of chitosan were used as the initial medium for printing tissue-engineering structures. Printing of structures was carried out using the laser device generating pulsed laser radiation. The radiation wavelength was 1064 nm (100 ns pulse duration, 100 kHz frequency). Laser radiation using the scanner system of the device was moved on the dispersion layer. A computer model regulated the trajectory of the movement of radiation. Results: We have demonstrated the effect of welding nanocarbon fibers into a framework under the action of laser irradiation. The functionalization of nanocarbon fibers by protein and amino sugar molecules were proven. It was found the diameter of nanocarbon fibers was increased by several tens of nanometers due to their wrapping with a bio-organic matrix. Tissue-engineering structures had a meshy frame. The mesh size was 100x100 mu m. The electrical conductivity of the structures increased several times and amounted to 1 S/m with laser irradiation. The hardness of tissue-engineering structures was 150-370 MPa. The cytological compatibility of tissue-engineering structures with fibroblast cells and endothelial cells was tested. The density of proliferating cells on tissue-engineering structures was 33% more compared to the control type. In vivo investigations indicated the rate of biodegradation of tissue-engineering structures when implanted in laboratory animals for 60-90 days. Discussion: The investigated structures are promising for use in medical practice. Such structures can act as cardiac tissue-engineering implants since they have physicomechanical and biological properties similar to the parameters of cardiac tissue.
   Objectives: A major part of developing rotary blood pumps requires the optimization of hemolytic properties of the entire pump. The aim of this project was to compare blood flow simulation in the first and second generations of the ventricular assist device Sputnik and to evaluate its effect. Methods: Studies of the flow field were conducted with commercial CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 16.0, which uses a finite-volume approach. Scalar shear stresses were calculated for both pumps. The pumps were compared in terms of volumes subjected to certain viscous shear stress thresholds, below which no trauma was assumed (von Willebrand factor cleavage: 9 Pa, platelet activation: 50 Pa, and hemolysis: 150 Pa), associated residence times and recirculation zones. Results: Volume fractions of shear stress above 9 Pa, 50 Pa, 150 Pa were received: Sputnik-1 had 7.69 ml, 2,58ml, 0.74 ml, Sputnik-2 - 3.41 ml, 1.07 ml, 0.22 ml. The sum of the cell residence times at these shear stresses is 0.5095 s for the Sputnik-1 and 0.2019 s for the Sputnik-2. The volumes of recirculation zones were obtained, the value is 4.36 ml for the Sputnik-1 and 1.72 ml for the Sputnik-2. Discussion: The second generation of the VAD Sputnik have better flow characteristics than first. In the operating point, the volume fraction of the shear stresses is less, the residence time is less and the volume of recirculation zones is less.
   Objectives: End-stage renal disease is increasing dramatically in the western world and represents a major challenge for health care. Due to organ shortage transplantation can help only a few patients who otherwise require lifelong hemodialysis. Access for hemodialysis is an essential point and carries a high morbidity mainly due to occlusion of arterio-venous fistulas (AVF) and/or grafts (AVG). Therefore, alternative graft material has to be considered such as tissue engineered vascular grafts for access in hemodialysis. Methods: Besides patient characteristics and technical issues of surgical procedures the choice of the vascular graft is essential. Despite optimization over the last years, the clinical results are still sub-optimal due to early thrombosis and late intimal hyperplasia of the non-degradable synthetic vascular grafts such as Expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), or, polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron). Results: New material developments and tissue engineering techniques have shown good pre-clinical and initial clinical results for AVG implantation in hemodialysis patients. These range from acellular and cell-based, stable or bio-degradable, synthetic scaffolds to biological (mandril-induced) or decellularized grafts as well as self-assembly technologies. Discussion: This symposium will review the clinical need and especially address new developments of vascular grafts based on tissue engineering.
   Modern heart failure therapy makes use of left ventricular assist devices for severe cases as well as other active implants. While these devices have come far from their beginnings with improved hemocompatibility, smaller size and less invasive implantation techniques, their advancement takes close cooperation of engineers and clinicians to face the challenges of further advancements. It is vital to ensure interdisciplinary communication and exchange to define the future of Mechanical Circulatory Support. On the engineering side, greater biocompatibility, patient-specificity and options for smart devices and telemedicine offer great potential. These developments go hand in hand with improved surgical technique and clinical expertise. This cooperation will allow us to work towards reduced mortality, less adverse clinical events and ultimately improved quality of life for the cardiac assist device patient of the future.
   Objectives: To elucidate the role of the solvent and pH in the conformational changes of human serum albumin (HSA) and its binding to fatty acids. Albumin is a key biomolecule, found in most fluids of the body. HSA functions as depot and carrier for many compounds like fatty acids and affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Importantly, HSA acts as a toxic waste handler, displays pseudo enzymatic properties and it is a valuable biomarker in many diseases. Structurally, HSA is a very soluble, extremely robust and usually monomeric protein, which features three alpha-helical homologous domains that fold into a characteristic heart shape. Despite its importance, the reversible pH-dependent conformational transitions of HSA in solution are not yet fully understood. Methods: To compute the stability differences between the different conformers of HSA, we combine molecular dynamics simulations (MD) with free energy calculations. We determine the conformational free-energy change between conformers of HSA obtained upon introducing perturbations in the surroundings (pH, solvent mixtures) and its physiologically native state. Extended constant-pH MDs followed by Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics simulations allow us modelling these systems at different pH values. We perform free energy perturbation calculations to characterize the binding sites of fatty acids to HSA under different conditions. Results and Discussion: We elucidate, at the molecular level, the effects of the solvent and pH on the conformational transitions and functionality of HSA. Our work allows establishing ways to modulate such transitions by tuning key biomolecular interactions, with implications for biomedical research.
   Objectives: The metal ions can affect differentiation of stem cells, which makes them interesting for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative in medicine. The layer-by-layer (LbL) technique is based on the alternating adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to form polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM). Multilayer systems combined with metal ions of different concentration might be promising for making coatings on implants and scaffolds to regenerate tissues like bone, cartilage, and others. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the concentration of metal ions on the physical properties of Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM), and evaluate the effect of metal ions on stem cell adhesion. Methods: Polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) prepared by layer-by-layer technique made of polysaccharides hyaluronan (HA) as polyanion and chitosan (Chi) as polycation were additionally cross-linked by metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+, Ca2+ and Fe3+). to modulate physical properties and bioactivity of multilayers to control adhesion and function of mesenchymal murine C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblasts. Characterization of multilayer formation and surface properties was performed by different analytical methods. Results: Changes of wetting, thickness and mechanical properties of multilayers depending on concentration and type of metal ion. Most interesting, however, was the finding that metal ions like Fe3+ promoted adhesion and spreading of C3H10T1/2 cell greatly on the less adhesive HA/Chi multilayer system Discussion: Multilayer systems combined with metal ions can be used to regenerate tissues like bone, cartilage and others
   Objectives: The aim of the study is to analyse and modify the gas transfer properties of a novel PMP fiber blood gas exchanger with a cylindrical shaped blood flow channel by improving the sweep gas flow profile through the fiber bundle while considering the fiber length in blood contact. Methods: A test set-up has been developed to visualize the gas flow through the fiber bundle by means of steam. In an in-vitro setting with porcine blood the gas transfer rate has been measured subsequently. The cylindrical blood flow geometry and the fact that the fibers are stacked with an offset of 90 degrees onto each other results in fibers with various effective lengths. For the study, various prototypes of gas inlets with different inlet geometries have been designed, manufactured and evaluated regarding their gas transfer rates. Results: The different designs resulted in the aimed flow profiles during the flow visualization. Selected prototypes have been tested with blood and the gas transfer rates have been determined. However, the modified designs with improved gas flow properties do not significantly impact the gas transfer rates measured with blood. Discussion: Two possible explanations can be derived from the results which may be tested in the course of further studies. Firstly, it is possible that the current gas inlet is already sufficiently adapted to the cylindrical blood flow geometry and fibers of different effective length. Secondly, it could be considered that side parameters such as the diffusive transfer of water vapour from the blood side to the gas side have a superseding influence on the gas flow profile. In conclusion, the gas transfer rates cannot be significantly increased by manipulating the gas flow profile through the fiber bundle. Nevertheless, the blood gas exchanger achieves already comparable transfer rates to products on the market but has reduced PMP membrane surface.
   Objectives: Throughout the history of medical devices, highly invasive systems underwent a series of generations prior a successful establishment as a widely accepted therapy. The only available THA today (SynCardia TAH) is successfully saving lives but comes with a significant restriction of the quality of life (QoL) and a stigmatization of the patients. According to surgeons this is an important factor contributing to the low number of implantations today. Methods: Next generation devices using an implanted drive promise a new level of QoL and are currently developed by several institutions worldwide. Reasons for the long time to market of the next TAH generation (>15 years) might be found in the enormous challenges of technological aspects together with a difficult marked situation from an investors point of view. However, a higher QoL and an increasing trust in the reliability of the next TAH generations will inherently lead to a higher number of implantations, and further the acceptance of these devices towards an established therapy option. Results: The approach of the ReinHeart TAH is to adopt the well-proven hydraulic features of the SynCardia TAH while improving its current limitations. The ReinHeart TAH features a passive filling during diastole, a principal that is also successfully applied by the SynCardia TAH. The simple and robust linear driving mechanism allows for a compact design, achieving fit in the vast majority of patients. Beyond that, the drive principle makes additional sensors unnecessary. The compact, smart and usability-driven design of the external components will lead to a broad acceptance by the patients. Discussion: The unique features of the ReinHeart TAH elevate TAH-therapy to the next evolutionary step with regards to robust long-term application, size, ease of use and quality of life.
   Objectives: Circulating endothelial cells can be used to diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, their concentration in the blood is very low (<100 per ml). A large volume of blood is needed, which should not be drawn from the patient. Instead a probe is inserted into the bloodstream of the patient to isolate as many cells as possible. The geometry of the cell probe is one of the key factors affecting cell deposition because its shape influences the flow conditions along the cell probe. The aim of this combined in vitro and in silico study is to find out the optimal flow conditions for cell deposition aiming to develop in future novel optimal cell probe shape. Methods: In vitro experiments in a closed loop with endothelial cells from HUVEC cell line were carried out and the cell deposition as a function of the probe shape (4 probe types) and five different flow rates were investigated. The knowledge of the flow conditions at the cell probe was obtained by flow simulations by using CFD software STAR CCM+. By combining the experimental and simulation data with an iterative procedure, wall shear stresses, which seems to promote cell deposition, can be identified. Results: It could be shown that the geometry of the cell probe has a much greater influence on cell deposition than the flow rates in the blood vessel. Wall shear stress around 0.4 Pa seems to be responsible for the optimal deposition of endothelial cells. However, this flow condition does not correlate with all flow rate experiments. Discussion: The results of the combined in vitro - in silico study on deposition of endothelial cells on the existing cell probe design are promising. However, the used in vitro set up does not allow to extract maximal information from each test and should be redesigned.
   Objectives: The left ventricular assist device (LVAD) consists of the pump, driveline and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure. According to the recent research only 13% of failures were due to the pump itself, while over 60% were due to batteries, controllers and peripheral cables. Taking into account usability factors we present a novel control unit for the rotary blood pumps aimed to decrease LVAD malfunction. Methods: The pump motor windings are leaded out by doubled wires (six total) via driveline to the extracorporeal splitter where the driveline is divided by two ways. Each way consists of three pump motor phase signals and three current sense signals from the other way. The two identical control units with integrated rechargeable batteries are connected to each way of the splitter simultaneously. This symmetrical peripherals architecture allows each control unit to drive the pump (in the active mode) or sense the parameters from the parallel way (in the passive mode). The control is based on the field oriented control method that allows the passive unit to continuously monitor the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field vector in the pump, which is created by the active unit and, upon loss of control, immediately begins to generate control signals with the necessary amplitude and phase. In case of mismatch of the parameters in any control units, alarms are to occur. Results: Novel Sputnik LVAD was developed according to the described philosophy. This LVAD system has a backup feature which covers almost all peripherals including driveline, control system and battery. In case of the single fault condition in the peripherals the system continues to drive the pump with pause in the control less than 4 ms. Discussion: Developed peripherals integrated in the LVAD allow reducing the risk of the device malfunction and improving usability.
   Objectives: Polysaccharides belong to the most abundant biomaterials on earth. They form structural elements of plant and animal tissues, but many of them have also important regulatory functions towards cells, tissues and organs. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and other carboxylated and sulfated polysaccharides possess a bioactivity that is due to their high affinity to a plethora of proteins forming insoluble and soluble components of cell environments, but also direct interaction with cell receptors. Methods: Making surface coatings for implants from natural or semisynthetic GAG that guide cell behavior requires different strategies of covalent or physical attachment. Simple covalent binding mechanisms can be based on oxidation of pendant hydroxyl groups of monosaccharide subunits or introduction of reactive side groups like thiols that permit direct coupling to surfaces. Results: Physical can exploit the inherent charge of these molecules that permits formation of multilayers kept together by ion pairing, but also intrinsic cross-linking of activated GAG. Both mechanism can be also used to form 3D structures as biocompatible in situ gelling hydrogels that permit embedding of growth factors and cells. Discussion: These 2D and 3D systems are instructive controlling cell spreading, growth and differentiation, which will be shown with examples on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem and other cells.
   Objectives: A successful creation and adequate maturation of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) provides efficient treatment and long term patient survival. The aim of the study was to determine the predictors for primary failure of AVF, such as gender, age, AVF site of creation, and primary renal disease, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4/5. Methods: The medical records of 178 created arteriovenous fistulae in patients with CKD stage 4/5, in a single center for the year 2018, were retrospectively studied. Primary failure of AVF was defined as thrombosis or inability for cannulation of the fistula within 3 months of creation. Early thrombosis of AVF was defined as an immediate failure due to thrombosis of the fistula within 24 hours of creation. Adequate maturation of AVF was defined as successful cannulation of AVF for efficient HD. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59.75 +/- 14.65 years, and 65.16% (116/178) were men. Adequate maturation of fistulae was achieved in 83.71% (149/178). Primary failure of AVF occurred in 16.29% (29/178) of the created fistulae, while 10.11% (18/178) had early thrombosis. Distal AVF (radio-cephalic) was the dominant site with 38.76% (69/178) of the created fistulae, followed by middle-arm AVF (radio-cephalic) site in 32.02% (57/178) and proximal AVF (brachio-basilic) site in 29.22% (52/178) of the created fistulae. The distal fistulae were significantly more frequently created in male patients (51 vs 18; p=0,015). The female patients were significantly older than the male patients (63.27 vs 57.86 years; p=0,018). The patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were significantly older than the non-DM patients (63.65 vs 58.05 years; p=0,018). Discussion: Hospital strategy for creation of a permanent vascular access for hemodialysis is an "Arteriovenous fistula first". The female gender was more frequently associated with primary failure of AVF, while age, AVF creation site, and primary renal disease were not.
   Objectives: Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its co-polymer with trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) demonstrating biocompatibility and piezoelectric property are among the most promising biomaterials for nerve regeneration. Their blends with polydiphenylene phthalide (PDP) can improve nerve tissue regeneration due to combined electrical switching effect of PDP. Methods: Electrospinning and film casting were used to produce porous electrospun fibre mats and thin films, respectively. SEM, DSC, RAMAN and FTIR spectroscopy, as well as piezoelectric measurements were performed to analyse morphology and physical-chemical properties of initial and final materials. A special measuring cell was designed to conduct dielectric spectroscopy measurements on samples with both deposited and pressed contacts. Results: Electrospun PVDF-TrFE and PVDF-TrFE+PDP fibre mats and casted PVDF-TrFE, PVDF, PVDF-TrFE+PDP film samples were produced. The range of fibre diameter of 0.5-1.2 mu m was obtained from SEM images. RAMAN (500-3500 cm(-1)) and FTIR (600-2000 cm(-1)) spectra were obtained for initial and final materials. The dependence of the samples capacity on the uniaxial pressure was measured. The frequency dependence of the capacitance and tangent of the dielectric loss angle tg(delta) at a constant uniaxial pressure has also been analysed. Discussion: RAMAN spectrum of PDP+PVDF-TrFE fibre mats contains peaks from PDP and PVDF-TrFE, indicating that electrospinning method is suitable to produce PDP-containing PVDF-TrFE materials. Results of dielectric measurements showed that the presence of TrFE in co-polymer significantly reduces the value of the samples' capacitance. The capacitance of fibrous samples is much lower than that of films due to high porosity of fibre mats (>90%). TrFE-containing samples demonstrate high dielectric losses at low frequencies. The combined analysis of dielectric and piezoelectric properties is ongoing.
   Objectives: The objective of this study is the development of a magnetic levitation system of a new type of blood pump. A fully magnetically levitated plate is oscillating in a trapezoidal shaped pump housing to create a relatively blood gentle flow. The oscillating movement of the plate is realized with a combination of a driven harmonic oscillator and a 1-degree-of-freedom magnetic levitation system. Methods: Multiple design concepts utilizing different electromagnetic principles were 3D modelled with Solid Works and imported into Ansys Mawell 3D to execute electromagnetic FEM simulations. Based on the results, the most suitable concept was selected by means of electromagnetic performance, stability, use of space and general feasibility. A PID-controller was implemented using Matlab/Simulink. The feasibility and stability of the concept was tested on a full-scale prototype. Results: The prototype demonstrates the feasibility and stability of the concept. The stabilization of the plate can be realized with an electric current that is about 7 times lower than bearable for the electromagnetic coils of the first prototype, allowing further miniaturization of future prototypes. Discussion: Though the general feasibility of the concept could be demonstrated, tests of the pumping performances are still pending to evaluate the suitability of the pump as an implantable blood pump.
   Objectives: Long term survival rate after the resection for the esophageal carcinoma has not been satisfactory. One of the most important topics in the area of the esophageal cancer is the reconstruction of the esophageal tract. If the artificial esophagus can be constructed, this technology will be beneficial for patients with esophageal cancer in the advanced stage. Methods: In the previous reports, artificial esophagus with shape memory (SMA) alloy actuator had been reported. However, total occlusion of the esophageal tract had been difficult. In this study, Origami engineering technology had been used for the peristaltic motion. Triangle shape of the Origami structure had been designed in this study for the total occlusion of the esophageal tracts to prevent the gastroesophageal reflux. The corner of the triangle had been pulled by SMA actuators following the diagonal lines for the folding power. Results: In the design concept of this artificial esophagus, the artificial esophageal tracts will be sutured to the human's esophagus. In this stage, the artificial esophageal tracts were consisted by the artificial vessel's material, and in the next stage regenerative esophagus will be the candidates. Esophageal tracts will be covered with triangle shape tracts with SMA actuator to embody the peristalsis. In the results in this study, total occlusion of the artificial esophageal tracts had been embodied by the use of the Origami structure. Through the arrangement of the triangle shape origami structures, co-driving will be embodied for the peristalsis function. Discussion: Until now, there had been no success in achieving peristalsis motion of the artificial esophagus. For the application of the human esophageal tracts, more study is necessary. This study was the first step for the application of the new artificial esophagus in the world for the achievement of the totally occluded peristalsis.
   Objectives: The transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived grafts represents an alternative treatment option for post-myocardial infarction patients. So far, myocardial tissue engineering mainly focused on the generation of ventricular-like tissues providing sufficient contractile function. Atrial- and pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes (CMs) are hypothesized to have a negative effect on tissue function, as they could lead to a lower force development and to arrhythmias after transplantation, respectively. Therefore, we aim to characterize subtype composition in the differentiated CM cultures, as well as in generated tissues thereof and analyze tissue functionality. Methods: The hiPSC-CMs are then mixed with human fibroblasts and a matrix to generate bioartifical cardiac tissues (BCTs) using our established bioreactor technology. In order to assess the ratio of individual iPSC-derived CM subtypes, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence (IF) stainings with antibodies targeting subtype-specific markers (MLC2v, COUPTF-2, and MLC2a) were performed. Results: First results revealed a high percentage (80-90%) of MLC2v positive cells in differentiated CM populations. The remaining cells stained positive for atrial markers (COUPTF-2, MLC2a). Functional measurements mainly focused on BCT contractility and showed forces similar to the native myocardium (6.5 mN/mm2). In addition, we observed that a higher proportion of ventricular-like CMs leads to higher contractile BCT function. Discussion: Taken together, these molecular and functional results reveal that our differentiation protocol led to the formation of mainly ventricular-like CMs and that BCTs generated thereof show typical characteristics of myocardial tissues. For future ventricular-like tissue replacement therapy, we aim to perform a risk assessment for "contaminating" cardiac cell types with respect to both BCT function and arrhythmias.
   Objectives: Standardized hemolysis tests according to ASTM F1841-97 (2017) are the current gold standard for hemolysis evaluation. As part of the standard flow loop, a screw clamp is used to regulate the flow resistance in the circulations. Especially with extracorporeal pumps used for lung support, cardiopulmonary bypass application, or C0(2)-Removal, resistance has to maintain a pressure gradient of more than 500 mmHg. As a consequence, the screw clamp itself turns into a critical hemolysis hotspot, possibly overlying and biasing the hemolysis caused by the tested pump. Therefore, we present an alternative resistance causing only low hemolysis and at the same time maintaining ASTM testing specifications. Methods: We developed one novel resistance and evaluated the hemolysis potential of the novel and one alternative in flow loops. The flow loops were set up according to the ASTM standard with three identical pumps (Deltastream (R) DP3, Medos AG), two with the novel and alternative resistances each and one with the state-of-the art resistance, the screw clamp. The loops were set to high pressure conditions present in cardiopulmonary bypass applications, ECMO or C0(2)-Removal. The loops operated for 6 hours with porcine blood (n = 6). Blood samples were drawn hourly and free plasma hemoglobin was evaluated by means of photometric measurement. Results: A new resistance for ASTM pump evaluation at high pressure regimes with little impact on hemolysis was developed. The resistance is easy to integrate into the recirculation loop and can be adjusted continuously. In-vitro blood trials revealed lower hemolysis for the new resistance compared to the current gold standard. Discussion: Extracorporeal continuous flow blood pumps with transfemoral cannulation work against high pressure at low flow. Up to now, hemolysis evaluation of the pumps is biased by hemolysis caused by the flow loop resistance. Our newly designed resistance causes less hemolysis, thus allowing for more meaningful and reliable hemolysis test results.
   Objectives: To characterize the biological background of prothrombotic platelet function in the setting of durable Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) with Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) and to evaluate influence of different antithrombotic regimens dictated by specific clinical needs. Methods: Platelet thrombin generation was quantified in 75 LVAD patients implanted with the HeartMate II (n=10, 13%), HeartMate 3 (n=27, 36%), or HeartWare HVAD (n=38, 51%) using the Platelet Activity State (PAS) Assay and the Thrombin Generation Test (TGT). Data was compared in patients managed with i) oral anticoagulation plus aspirin (n=46, 61%) or ii) anticoagulation alone (n=29, 39%) due to significant bleeding risk. Coagulation parameters (platelet count, International Normalized Ratio [INR], activated Partial Thromboplastin Time [aPTT], Fibrinogen and D-Dimers levels) and hemolysis index (lactate dehydrogenase levels, LDH) were also recorded to comprehensively characterize hemostatic profiles and actual prothrombotic risk in the two groups. Results: The PAS assay revealed low-intensity increase in platelet prothrombinase activity in patients without aspirin (1.13-fold higher; p=0.04). Similarly, the TGT revealed moderate higher platelet reactivity in patients not on aspirin, consistent with reduction of lag time (0.87-fold lower; p<0.001), increase in peak of thrombin generation (1.5-fold higher; p=0.002) and thrombin generation rate (2-fold higher; p=0.01), but comparable endogenous thrombin potential (p>0.05). Coagulation parameters and LDH levels were not different in these two groups (p>0.05). Discussion: In patients with a durable MCS, aspirin minimally modulates the biochemical pathway of platelet thrombin generation. Re-evaluation of antithrombotic management criteria in selected patients stratified according to bleeding risk might significantly reduce LVAD hemcompatibility-related adverse events.
   Objectives: To determine the value of post-reperfusion kidney biopsyin predicting renal function and the incidence rate of DGF in deceased donor renal transplant recipients within 1 year after the surgery. Methods: We retrospectively included 461 patients who accepted the donation after the death of citizen at our center. According to the Remuzzi criteria, we compared the pathological biopsy and graft outcome between right and left donor kidneys from the same donor.Remuzzi score  pound 3 was divided into low group, 4-6 middle group, > 6 high group. The incidence of delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR) and renal function within 1 year after surgery was observed. A multivariate analysis was conducted on the risk factors of kidney function and DGF incidence. Results: Of the 461 recipients,458 recipients have good graft function and 3 grafts failed. The reperfusion kidney biopsy, the incidence of graft DGF and renal function at each time point after transplantation between the left and right kidneys from the same donor were same (p>0.05). 88.1% was in low group, 10.4% in middle group, and 1.5% in high group. The incidence of DGF and the eGFR in different time points after transplantation were different (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that last creatinine before acquisition and Remuzzi score were independent predictors of DGF after transplantation (p<0.05). Vascular scores were independent risk factors affecting renal function at 1 year after transplantation(p<0.05) Discussion: The reperfusion renal allograft biopsy can reflect the donor's baseline data and predict early renal function after transplantation. Renal vascular disease may be an independent predictor of poor prognosis of the graft.
   The ongoing development of modern manufacturing processes, as well as the automation and cross-linking of production facilities opens up new freedoms for the individualized manufacturing of medical devices. The patient-specific design of these highly loaded devices is associated with a high degree of experience on the part of the designer. The assessment of the safety and performance of these " lot size 1 products" cannot be carried out economically by mechanical testing. This results in a verification gap in the product life cycle of patient-specific medical devices. A verification of the design and thus the evaluation of the function and safety of the products can only be carried out economically with the help of automated numerical simulations. A software to perform virtual strength assessment of custom implants was developed. The lecture shows how the verification process of patient-individual designs with numerical methods, can contribute to the increase of patient safety. In addition, the integration and documentation of numerical simulations within the product life cycle will be presented using industrial examples.
   Objectives: One of the most pressing issues of regenerative medicine is the fabrication of constructs with defined parameters in order to create conditions for proper cell adhesion and proliferation that will be close to native tissue conditions. An application utilizing the electrospinning method may potentially solve this problem. The main goal of this study was to fabricate electrospun scaffolds based on silk fibroin and to characterize their properties. Methods: Silk fibroin scaffolds were obtained by electrospinning method. There were two types of scaffolds: 1) silk fibroin scaffolds, 2) silk fibroin scaffolds with addition of 30 per cent of gelatin by mass. Scaffold structure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and scanning probe nanotomography. Cell adhesion and proliferation were investigated in mice fibroblasts 3T3 model. The regenerative potential of scaffolds was estimated in a model of Wistar rat full-thickness skin wound regeneration. Results: The electrospun scaffolds have fibrous porous structure with an average fiber thickness 300-600 nm. Both types of scaffolds are biocompatible in vitro. Presence of gelatin in scaffold composition improves cell proliferation. Scaffolds promote skin wound regeneration and restore native skin structure. Histological analysis did not evolve inflammatory process. Discussion: Electrospinning is a promising method to obtain fibrous biomimetic constructs with defined properties. The biocompatibility of produced constructs was shown in vitro and in vivo. Both types of scaffolds have a significant regenerative potential and are prospects for different fields of regenerative medicine.
   Objectives: Biodegradable PCL-based electrospun scaffolds are often used in TE. However, such scaffolds lack biocompatibility, wettability and chemical accessibility for tendon replacement applications. Here, we propose a new method to overcome those shortcomings by using PCL:Chitosan-graft-PCL (PCL:CS-g-PCL) blends instead of post-process coatings. Methods: Blended solutions of PCL (175 mg/ml in 2,2,2-TFE) and CS-g-PCL (1200 mg/ml in chloroform) were electrospun into scaffolds with CS-g-PCL from 0 to 90 wt% (10 ratios). SEM based measurements were carried out to investigate fiber diameter and morphology. Chitosan amino groups within the fibers were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). DSC measurements were conducted to assess thermal properties and crystallinity. Subsequently, metabolic activity of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) seeded on the scaffolds, was determined over 7 days. Results: Blends with CS-g-PCL contents < 90 wt% led to fiber diameter of 1 +/- 0.35 mu m and to 2 +/- 0.38 mu m for 90 wt%. XPS measurements showed an enrichment of chitosan amino groups at the surface of the fibers. The enthalpy of fusion increased by up to 40 J/g for CS-g-PCL contents from 0 to 90 wt%, indicating a significant increase in crystallinity. hMSCs had maximum metabolic activity on samples with CS-g-PCL contents between 10 and 30 wt%. Discussion: Electrospinning of blended PCL:CS-g-PCL solutions resulted in higher crystallinity while preserving mechanical properties. Furthermore, increased wettability improved biocompatibility and chemical accessibility, which ultimately influenced the metabolic activity of the hMSCs positively. This promising novel approach will increase the biocompatibility of PCL-based scaffolds with simultaneous reduction in production complexity.
   Objectives: Biventricular assist device (BVAD) is reported to be used in 3-5% of continuous-flow VAD (cf-VAD). Our recent strategy is to stabilize INTERMACS profile 1 or unstable profile 2 patients by paracorporeal VAD, central ECMO or IABP before proceeding to cf-VAD. Patients with RV failure are also aggressively treated by PDE-5 inhibitors or endothelin receptor antagonist at the outpatient clinic after implant. We examined validity of this strategy by analyzing BVAD necessity and patient survival. All cf-VAD was used for bridge to transplantation. Average waiting time for heart transplantation is nearly 3.5 years in our country. Methods: 166 consecutive patients were implanted with cf-VAD. DCM was seen in 113, ICM in 14, dHCM in 12, post-myocarditis CM in 6, ARVC in 3, RCM in 3 and others in 15. 130 patients underwent primary cf-LVAD implantation. Pre-implant profiles of those patients were 2 in 62, 3 in 62 and 4 in 6. 36 patients were converted from another type of mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Actuarial survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and comparisons were made using Log-rank method. Results: No patient required RVAD at the time of implantation nor late after implantation. Average support duration was 787 days, and 53 patients were on the support longer than 3 years. During follow-up 56 patients reached transplantation, 9 weaned from VAD due to functional recovery and 80 on-going support. 1-, 2-, 3-year survival of 166 patients was 92.8%, 89.5% and 85.9%. There were no statistical differences between subgroups, such as sex, pre-implant profile, body size and primary/redo sternotomy. Discussion: We successfully implanted cf-LVAD and managed in the outpatient clinic without RVAD support in 166 consecutive patients, including those who were severely ill in the pre-implant stage. Our strategy for stabilizing profile 1 and unstable profile 2 patients by other types of MCS and aggressive use of PDE-5 inhibitors or endothelin receptor antagonist seemed to be safe and effective.
   Objectives: Recently, composite bionanomaterials containing biological materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been actively studied. CNTs may contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles and they can affect the properties of the composite bionanomaterial. To the study of this issue, we paid attention. The object of the study was a composite nanomaterial consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA - matrix) and single-walled CNT (SWCNT - filler). Methods: Aqueous dispersion in the composition of 20 wt.% BSA and 0.01 wt.%. SWCNTs were prepared using traditional nanotechnology methods (thorough mixing, ultrasonic homogenization, decanting, etc.). The optical density of dispersion was measured after a magnetic field gradient ( 1 T/m) was applied to it for 100 hours. The obtained values were compared with the optical dispersion density in the absence of a magnetic field. Recent samples were considered control. Results: It was found that under the action of a magnetic field, the optical density of the water dispersion of BSA/SWCNT in the region of 300 divided by 800 nm decreases by > 10% relative to control samples. Additionally, it was found that under the action of a magnetic field, the optical density of the aqueous dispersion of BSA/SWCNT decreases by > 10% relative to control samples. Discussion: The decrease in the optical dispersion density of BSA/SWCNT is caused by the deposition of nanotubes on the cell surface under the action of a magnetic field gradient. It is assumed that the single walled carbon nanotubes contain catalytic ferromagnetic nanoparticles. Estimates showed that in bionanomaterial at a level with concentrations > 0.0001 wt.% CNT nanotubes can be fixed with modern sensors of a weak magnetic field with a threshold sensitivity of <= 1 pT. It was concluded that changes in implants in the BSA/SWCNT composite bionanomaterials can be observed non-invasively with the help of weak magnetic field sensors (for example, SQUID or CMFS).
   Objectives: Recent developments in imaging technology have enabled cryobiologists to reveal some mechanisms employed by nature to cope with freezing stress. The systematic study of these mechanisms may prove useful for developing ultimately novel and efficient cryopreservation protocols. In this work, we examine the potential advantages of using infrared video thermography (IVT) for monitoring latent heat release and freeze-thaw events in 3D porous collagen-hydroxyapatite scaffolds used as a model system. In this context, we present ongoing results on the identification of warm ice-nucleating agents (INA) from Hippophae rhamnoides with potential use in cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs (TECs). Methods: The scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying of mineralized collagen suspensions and characterized by Raman microscopy, X-ray microcomputed tomography and differential scanning calorimetry. Visualization of freezing/thawing events in scaffolds frozen with and without cryoprotective solutions based on leaf homogenate from Hippophae rhamnoides was performed using the thermography-based platform developed at the University of Thessaly. Results: Scaffolds presented 3D porous architecture and characteristic RAMAN peaks of collagen type I and hydroxyapatite (HAP). Presence of HAP decreased the specific heat capacity of collagen scaffolds. The probability of ice nucleation was higher in cryoptotective solutions with scaffolds than in solutions without. The ice nucleation temperature within scaffolds using INA was determined to be around -1.5 degrees C. Discussion: IVT proved to be a very effective approach for visualizing latent heat release and freeze-thaw events within scaffolds frozen in cell culture plates. INA from Hippophae rhamnoides may potentially be used for prevention of supercoiling in cryopreservation. The results obtained could serve as a basis for further development of efficient cryopreservation protocols for 3D TECs.
   Objectives: In the development process of heart assist devices, numerical simulations become more and more essential. The variety of applications comprises different types of cannulas or flow geometries of ventricular assist devices (VADs). The analysis of the flow field inside VADs by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is extremely useful. Numerical parameter studies allow the treatment of several device related problems in conjunction with a well-balanced cost-benefit ratio. Methods: Results obtained from properly performed CFD calculations permit the determination of flow induced blood damage of new flow designs in VADs and enable the prediction of the risk of harmful hemolysis for the patient. The literature provides different models for blood cell damages. In application, a proper definition of acceptable thresholds is required, in order to optimize blood guiding geometries as rotor blades or diffusor shapes in VADs. Another application of CFD can be found in the field of flow path optimization of new cannula designs. Corresponding results can lead to various design changes and can significantly contribute to a comprehensive risk analysis for regulatory assessment. Results: Based on the numerical results, geometrical design iterations can considerably improve the flow design of blood pumps and cannulas. Thoroughly optimized designs exert reduced shear stresses to the cells and create less damage to the patient's blood. Furthermore, CFD studies can provide valuable information in the process of risk analysis during the regulatory assessment of heart assist devices and support the interpretation of experimental in-vitro investigations. Discussion: Although numerical simulations represent a commonly used tool during research and development in the field of heart assist devices, the introduction of strict requirements and well-defined guidelines would considerably simplify the implementation of numerical studies for regulatory approval and enhance the comparability of independently gained results.
   Objectives: Current standards in cryopreservation for biomedical technology are still based on slow freezing processes inducing crystallization within the sample. In preparation for this cryopreservation regime, cells and tissues are detached from growth surfaces and dissociated into single cell suspensions. Existing infrastructures like freezing devices, lab ware, and liquid nitrogen tanks for long-term storage, are designed for the handling of suspended cells and tissues and for stock keeping purposes, these procedures usually are efficient enough. Through the addition of cryoprotective agents, the sample can cope with the emerging damaging mechanism resulting from ice crystal formation. However, diagnostically and therapeutically relevant cell systems, e.g. human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or their derivates like neuronal cells, depend on cell-cell and cell-surface interactions mediated by cytoskeletal proteins. Their structures are disordered, either due to these preparatory dissociating steps or due to crystallization, resulting in loss of functionality or cell loss in general. Methods: A second cryopreservation regime, the vitrification, avoids crystallization within the sample and thus avoids the occurring damaging mechanisms (e.g. shear forces, osmotic shock). Thereby, the structure of cells and tissues is preserved, leading to viable and functional cells even in their adherent state (with cell-cell and cell-surface contacts) after thawing. However, vitrification requires a skilled handling and so far, the infrastructure has not been established to enable routine vitrification workflows for large cell numbers. Results and Discussion: Our work shows the potential and capacity of vitrification on different cell types (e.g. hiPSCs, dopaminergic neurons). We demonstrate that vitrification is superior to slow freezing regarding cell loss and functionality and holds the possibility to cryopreserve scalable and ready-to-use cell products for a broad range of biomedical research.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to characterize the decellularized human chorion membrane (dHCM) and to study its suitability as a substrate to model biological barriers. Methods: HCMs were submitted to a chemical and physical decellularization process. The decellularization protocol was optimized by quantifying and analyzing the presence and distribution of cell nuclei and dsDNA by DAPI staining, PicoGreen and electrophoresis. The dHCM was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), immunohistochemistry, Dot-Blot, SDS-PAGE, and GAGs and Collagen quantification. Moreover, dHCM's mechanical properties were assessed and biocompatibility tests (metabolic and proliferation assays) with an endothelial human cell line (EA.hy.926) were performed. Results: The decellularization process of the HCM was successful, since the presence of nuclei was not observed, the amount of dsDNA was around 10 ng/mg of dry tissue, and the DNA fragments had less than 200 bp. A compact membrane that preserved the HCM's reticular layer and basement membrane was obtained. SEM images revealed that dHCM is a substrate with two different surfaces: one composed by nanofibers and the other (in trophoblast layer's side) covered by a thin compact layer (basement membrane). In tissue sections it was possible to verify the presence of collagen type I and IV, fibronectin and laminin in both dHCM and native tissue. Corroborating these results higher molecular weight species were preserved in dHCM (SDS-PAGE). Additionally, dHCM's mechanical properties were determined: young's modulus of 5.9 MPa and ultimate tensile strength of 5.3 MPa. Differences in metabolic activity and cell proliferation were observed between both sides of the dHCM. Discussion: dHCM retained the main proteins of the extracellular matrix. Cell proliferation and viability were higher in the side of dHCM that preserved the basement membrane. dHCM's physical and mechanical properties make it a suitable substrate to mimic biological barriers.
   Objectives: Cryogels with improved non-fouling and cell adhesive surface properties were investigated as potential cell scaffold for BAL purpose. Cryogel monolith columns were used by other groups to fill the bioreactor chamber. However, device performance was not maintained for more than a few hours. Fluid dynamic measurements using a purpose-built mu PIV setup with video post-processing were conducted in order to extrapolate the effect of flow inside the cryogel matrix to improve cell viability and avoid blood cell activation. Starting from PIV results, a multi-layered bioreactor composed of spaced cryogel discs was developed to maximise blood/hepatocyte mass-exchange. This study aimed to investigate whether the multi-layered design results in improved performance compared to the column version in terms of hepatocytes viability and functionality. Methods: p(HEMA-co-MBA) cryogels were synthesised by cryogelation technique. Cryogels were then functionalised with alginate and RGD peptide and synthesised by solid phase method. Porous structure was analysed with SEM, confocal imaging and mu CT. Non-fouling properties were investigated by protein absorption studies. Cell viability was assessed by MTT/ATP activity and live/dead imaging. Hepatocyte functionality in bioreactors was investigated by quantification of albumin and urea production using ELISA and colorimetric assay, respectively, over time. Results: Synthesised cryogels possessed an open porosity with pore sizes of up to 100 mu m and an interconnected network of pores. Alginate helped preventing protein absorption from plasma. RGD peptide enhanced hepatocyte functionality. Cryogel perfused bioreactors maintained hepatocytes viability and functionality for up to 1 week. Discussion: Multi-layered bioreactor design showed a significantly higher production of albumin and urea compared to the column version, suggesting an improved mass exchange between medium and cells. Also cell colonization and proliferation through the device were improved.
   Objectives: Placental complex, including placental tissues, foetal membranes, and umbilical cord, is one of the most promising sources of a range of tissues and cells for clinical and experimental application in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Certain components of placental material are already applied in medicine since decades, while others undergo intensive research and pre-clinical trials. Since placenta is a temporary organ, it provides the unique opportunity to obtain large amounts of tissues, including autologous, without the adverse effects to the donor. Moreover, great potential of placental multipotent stromal cells is recognized in generation of tissue engineered multicellular constructs. At the same time, clinical use and research proceedings are significantly restricted due to imperfections in storage technologies. Application of low-temperature preservation methods is especially challenging for 3-D multicellular structures, such as organs, tissues, and tissue engineered constructs. Methods: Here we aim to analyze the variety of cryoinjuries in a range of placental tissues and tissue engineered multicellular placental constructs, as well as support the cellular viability after low temperature storage. A range of cell and tissue culture as well as tissue engineering methods, cryomicroscopic analysis, evaluation of phenotypic and metabolic characteristics have been applied in this study. Results: Results have shown that the mechanisms of damage caused by cryopreservation procedures depend on particular structure of the studied object, peculiarities of intercellular bonds, as well as interaction with cryoprotective agents. At the same time, developed protocols allowed us to efficiently isolate viable cells after thawing of the studied tissues. Discussion: Conclusions of this study may lead to progress in improvement of biobanking technologies for tissues and tissue engineered multicellular constructs.
   Extracorporeal therapies, such as hemodialysis, apheresis or blood oxygenation, are only possible when recurrent blood access is feasible. Both, artificial grafts, e.g. made of polyethylene-terephthalate (Dacron (R)) or a fistula are not ideal models for that purpose and are commonly considered to represent the Achilles` Heel of extracorporeal blood circuits. A stable, implantable biologic vascular graft would be an ideal solution for the benefit of patients and many bioengineers are working on this dream to come true. When considering such a vascular graft to be used clinically and as a product to be sold in the medical device market, a series of problems with regard to approval have to be solved and some fundamental questions be answered. Regarding approval, current EU regulations refer to either the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) from 2017 or to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Regulation (ATMPs) from 2007. Under the premise "Better safe than sorry!" regulations, such as MDR and ATMP, represent a European law. A bioengineered vascular graft is taken as a "combination product", as it is commonly made of biological cells and a (possibly) biodegradable scaffold material. When implanted, it would represent a high-risk class III medical device under the MDR regulation and would require a CE-mark. The ATMP regulation, however, says that a combination product has to be approved following the "principal mode of action". For products containing viable cells or tissues, a specific approach has been taken by the EU. For these products it holds true that "whatever the role of the medical device, the pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action of these cells are considered to be the principal mode of action". Under these premises, a combination product, such as a bioengineered vascular graft, is regulated under the ATMP rules, which renders approval rather complex. Consequences refer to the need of Phase I-III clinical trials including post-market surveillance
   Neuroengineering is a research area where engineering skills are used to solve basic and clinical problems in neuroscience. The aim of the presentation is to give an insight into neuroengineering applied in neurosurgery. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a method for reducing symptoms in movement disorders as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. A thin electrode is surgically implanted with stereotactic technique at a well-defined brain structure. Our research focus on support systems for improving the surgical implantation procedure, and to increase the understanding of the DBS mechanism. A method for performing patient-specific simulations of the electric field around a DBS lead and map the data to the anatomy has been developed. The goal is to create improvement and side-disorder maps for the most common symptoms and brain targets used in DBS. Optics is another core area we apply in neurosurgery. Several optical probe systems for intraoperative guidance have been developed. Forward-looking probes can act as "vessel alarm" by recording the tissue's microcirculation with laser Doppler flowmetry during creation of the brain trajectories in relation to stereotactic neurosurgery. In DBS this method has been evaluated in the clinical setting in more than 100 implantations. For brain tumor biopsies the method is presently introduced in combination with 5-ALA fluorescence measurements at the tumor border. 5-ALA induced fluorescence spectroscopy- and microscopy can also be used together in brain tumor surgery. Under the neurosurgical "blue-light" microscope, a hand-held probe supports the surgeon by enhancing malignant tissue. Another challenge is optical monitoring of cerebral microcirculation in the neuro-intensive care setting. A prerequisite for successful project outcome is a close collaboration between biomedical engineers and neurosurgeons. difference.
   Objectives: The main goal of this study was to synthesize polysaccharide-based hydrogel systems that favor bone regeneration. The hydrogel formation is driven by Schiff base crosslinking reaction between the amino functionalities of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMChi) and the aldehyde groups of the different oxidized polysaccharides resulting in an imine bond formation. Methods: Different amounts of NaIO4 were used in order to oxidize Alginate (ALG) and Hyaluronic acid (HA), forming reactive dialdehyde derivatives with different oxidation degrees. The amount of aldehyde groups was determined by: A) using Schiff's reagent and detected by a UV-Vis spectrometer (550nm) and B) acid base titration after reacting the aldehyde groups with Hydroxylammoniumchloride. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) was used for molecular weight determination of the different polysaccharides. Biocompatibility of the products was tested using Qblue (R) assay and CFDA staining. Results: Data obtained from both UV-VIS spectroscopy and titration show that the different polysaccharides have more aldehyde groups when high concentrations of NaIO4 were used and the reaction times were extended. The weight average molecular weights of all the products were lower after the oxidation step. Products with high oxidation degrees showed low biocompatibility. Discussion: ALG and HA with high oxidation degrees are required to prepare stable hydrogel systems and the dual utility of using CMChi and oxidized polysaccharides as both structural and bioactive component is promising for the formation of biocompatible hydrogel systems that can be used for bone tissue regeneration.
   Objectives: Xenotransplantation of transgenic porcine pancreatic islets offers a promising alternative source to circumvent current limitations posed by the scarcity of allogeneic donors. However, either immune rejection or oxygen supply in immune protected encapsulated islets remains a major concern. To decrease xenogeneic immune responses, we have investigated the feasibility to generate tissue engineered SLA silenced islet cell clusters (ICC) from alpha-Gal knock out, CD46, CD55 and CD59 transgenic minipigs. Methods: Pancreatic islets single cell suspensions were generated by enzymatic digestion of porcine ICCs. The single cells were silenced for SLA class I and II by lentiviral vectors encoding for Nanoluciferase as reporter gene and for short hairpin RNAs targeting beta2-microglobulin (shb2m) or class II transactivator (shCIITA), respectively. SLA transcripts were evaluated by real-time PCR and protein levels by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analyses. Cell death was evaluated by Propidium Iodide staining. The effect of SLA class I silencing was evaluated in human T and NK cell cytotoxicity assays. SLA-silenced pancreatic beta-cells were then used to form new ICCs in stirred bioreactors. Results: SLA class I silencing was designed to reach a level of up to 86% and class II by up to 64% on pancreatic islet cell monolayers. Silencing SLA expression did not affect cell viability and the insulin-producing beta-cell phenotype as indicated by Dithizone staining and levels of insulin production. Xenogeneic T-cell immune responses (p<0.05) as well as antibody-mediated cellular-dependent immune responses (p<0.01) were significantly decreased. Silencing SLA class I expression did not increase susceptibility to NK-cell cytotoxicity. In stirred bioreactors, tissue engineered islets showing the typical 3D-structure and morphology of ICC were assembled from SLA-silenced pancreatic cell suspensions to be used for transplantation in humanized mice as a first model. Discussion: These data shows the feasibility to generate low immunogenic porcine ICC from transgenic pigs after single cell engineering and post- transduction islet reassembling that might serve as a robust alternative to allogeneic pancreatic islet cell transplantation.
   Objectives: In patients with circulatory support, preload is a valuable clinical monitoring variable. While it is difficult to measure directly, it can be indirectly measured by PCWP or left atrial pressure (LAP). Typically, assessments of LAP require invasive methods. However, non-invasive estimation of LAP can be a useful tool for monitoring patients and adjusting pump speed to reduce the likelihood of hazardous events, such as ventricular suction and pulmonary congestion. This study presents an artificial neural network model estimating the LAP noninvasively across different patient conditions. Methods: LAP was estimated based on the HeartWare HVAD pump characteristics (current, flow and speed) derived from 186 experiments performed in a mock circulatory system with HVAD speed range from 1800 to 3600 rpm. The LAP estimation was evaluated by measuring the hemodynamic variables in response to a range of changes to the mock cardiovascular system, including changes in PVR, SVR and HR. A neural network was trained with 70% of the data (randomly chosen), and was validated and tested with the rest of data. The model performance was quantified by the mean squared error (MSE), correlation coefficient (r2) and Bland-Altman plot between measured and estimated LAP in different scenarios. Results: The neural network model was able to estimate LAP accurately using data collected in-vitro for training, validation and test sets. The MSE for all data is 1.36 mmHg, and correlation coefficients are 0.99, 0.91 and 0.94 for training, validation and test sets, respectively. The Bland-Altman plot showed that error has a bias of 0.28 mmHg with a reproducibility coefficient of 2.2 mmHg. Discussion: The developed model would be useful for a real-time estimation of preload noninvasively which can be employed to adjust pump speed in heart-failure patients without inserting a pulmonary catheter into the pulmonary artery. Implementation of the developed estimator would also create a new physiological control system that can work noninvasively.
   Objectives: Blood vessels are integral to the maintenance of all tissues. They deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste. Blood vessels not only contain endothelial cells (ECs) that are in direct contact with flowing blood cells and fluids but they may also have pericytes and smooth muscle cells on the outside that stabilize and regulate their size. Defects in EC and pericyte/smooth muscle cell interaction are often implicated in many pathological conditions. Patients with a genetic disease called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) suffer from heavy and recurrent nosebleeds, due to unstable blood vessels as a result of defective interaction between ECs and pericytes. Methods: Here we used human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as a source of patient-specific cells, as they can be derived from all individuals, including children and patients with genetic disease and subsequently differentiated towards all cells of the body. Besides, we can now use hiPSCs to derive all the component of blood vessels in large numbers and use them to re-create blood vessels on a chip to model inflammation and disease. Results: HHT-hiPSC-ECs displayed no apparent functional differences using a set of standard two-dimensional (2D) assays. The ability of hiPSC-ECs to form a perfused microvascular network was next examined using three-dimensional (3D) cultures in microfluidic chips. Using these 3D vessels on a chip, we found that in contrast to 2D microvascular cultures, the ability to form 3D microvessels in microfluidic chips was strikingly compromised when HHT-hiPSC-ECs were used compared to isogenic control ECs. Discussion: This patient-based hiPSC model thus serves as the first proof of principle that vascular diseases could be modeled using patient-specific hiPSCs in 3D microfluidic chips and to identify new target cells and possible pathways for therapy.
   Objectives: This study was aimed at fabricating various layer-by-layer (LbL) systems using glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with the capability to bind BMP-2 specifically in order to control osteogenic differentiation of cells by biocompatible release systems. Methods: Heparin, chondroitin sulfate and their oxidized forms as polyanions were combined with chitosan and collagen I as polycations to form various multilayer coatings on model materials with the advantage of the intrinsic cross-linking formed between oxidized glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and polycations, improving multilayer stability and affecting the release of BMP-2. The myoblast cell line C2C12, which can differentiate into osteoblasts was seeded on 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 loaded multilayers. Cell viability, adhesion, osteogenic differentiation and BMP-2 release were investigated. Results: C2C12 cells cultured directly on the top of multilayers showed that particularly BMP-2 loaded multilayers made of oxidized GAGs promoted an osteogenic differentiation that was nearly comparable to the positive control, when 5 mu g/mL BMP-2 was added directly to the medium. Interestingly, the BMP-2 had synergistic effect on cell adhesion and spreading. BMP-2 in oxidized chondroitin sulfate multilayers was successfully loaded to the layers, sustainably released over time and affected cell differentiation more than the soluble BMP-2. Discussion: The results show that oxidized GAGs forming intrinsically cross-linked multilayers are useful as reservoirs for sustained release of BMP-2 in which the intrinsic cross-linking affected BMP-2 release, improved multilayers stability due to the resulting stiff surface compared to the native ones, supported cell adhesion, proliferation and subsequent differentiation. This can pave the way for coating implants and scaffolds for repair and regeneration of bone fractures.
   Objectives: Functional myocardial recovery during support with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is highly desirable but only observed in approx. 1% of all patients. Previously, the more frequently implanted pulsatile blood pumps (PBPs) showed higher recovery rates than the currently used rotary blood pumps (RBPs). The aim of this study was to comparatively assess the capability of PBPs and RPBs to unload the left ventricle and restore physiological cardiac energetics in isolated hearts. Methods: An RBP (Medtronic HVAD) and a heartbeat synchronized PBP (BerlinHeart Excor) were alternately connected to eight isolated porcine hearts. To modulate the mode of LVAD support, RBP rotational speed was set to different support levels and ejection delay of the PBP was phased from 0% to 90%. Pressures, flows, left ventricular volumes, and myocardial oxygen consumption were recorded and cardiac efficiency quantified by the ratio of external work (EW) over myocardial oxygen consumption. Results: With increasing RBP support, lower left atrial pressures (LAP) were found to coincide with a decreased cardiac efficiency (r=0.91 +/- 0.12) with a median [inter quartile range] slope of 0.28 [0.91] %/mmHg. In contrast, depending on the phase delay of ejection of a PBP, LAP and cardiac efficiency follow a sinusoidal course with the LAP minimum at 90% and efficiency maximum at 60%. Discussion: In RBP support, aggressive ventricular unloading was found to lead to lower cardiac efficiencies. On the other side, phasing of a PBP offers the possibility to restore cardiac efficiency and simultaneously unload the ventricle. These results may justify future studies linking optimized cardiac mechanics and efficiency to functional recovery and reverse myocardial remodeling with LVAD therapy.
   Objectives: We focused on the interventricular dyssynchrony caused by the shortened systole of left ventricle (LV) compared to right ventricle (RV) during left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. The purpose of this study was to assess and quantify the mechanical interventricular dyssynchorny according to the support condition using conductance catheter. Methods: We studied five goats with normal heart condition. A centrifugal LVAD was implanted under general anesthesia. We inserted the conductance catheter into the LV and RV and obtained the pressure-volume relationship. We defined the dyssynchronous status by the sign (plus or minus) of the LV volume (LVV) change is opposite to that of RV volume (RVV). (i.e., (dLVV/dt)*(dRVV/dt)<0). Interventicular dyssynchrony (DYS) was quantified by calculating the percentage of time within the cardiac cycle. Bypass rate was set dividing the LVAD pump flow by the main pulmonary artery flow. We calculated the DYS under LVAD support with various bypass rate. Results: The mean DYS of normal heart, LVAD clamp, LVAD support with bypass rate of 50%, 75 % and 100% were 6.0 +/- 1.3, 8.6 +/- 2.6, 9.6 +/- 1.8, 15.5 +/- 5.6, and 24.6 +/- 8.6, respectively. Also, there was a higher linear negative correlation between LV stroke volume and DYS. Discussion: Interventricular dyssynchrony during LVAD support was assessed and quantified using conductance catheters. Dyssynchrony became significant when the LV was unloaded with high rotational speed under LVAD support. Assessment of influences for the right ventricular function and heart failure models will be studied in the further study.
   Objectives: (Bio)chemical modification of implants with drug delivery systems can support the body's natural healing capabilities by imitation of smooth tissue transitions along bone-tendon conjunctions. Modified interconnected 3D porous poly(epsilon-caprolactone) could act as a scaffold material for these implants. Methods: Cocontinuous blends of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) were prepared by batch blending in an internal mixer. Annealing and leaching of the blends with water yielded the porous PCL scaffolds, which were then modified with chitosan (CS) grafted PCL (CS-g-PCL) via dip coating. Nanoparticle systems containing CS and tripolyphosphate (TPP) were obtained via ionotropic gelation. These CS-TPP nanoparticles (CSNPs) can be attached to the modified scaffolds via a Layer-by-Layer (LbL) deposition approach involving alginate (ALG). Results: Interconnected 3D porous PCL scaffolds with different morphologies have been prepared. Modification with CS-g-PCL, alginate, alginate fluorescein amine (ALG-FA), CS-TPP and fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled nanoparticles (CS-FITC-TPP) in a LbL approach was carried out. The blank scaffolds were analyzed in various ways, including via scanning electron microscopy and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Modified versions of the scaffolds were analyzed accordingly and the fluorescently labeled species were investigated via confocal laser scanning microscopy. CSNPs were loaded with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and layered on the modified scaffolds. Release of BSA from the scaffolds was investigated by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy at 37 degrees C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Discussion: Porous PCL scaffolds with different pore sizes and morphologies can be obtained via annealing and leaching of cocontinuous PCL/PEO blends. Surface modification with CS-g-PCL, alginate and CSNPs open up possibilities regarding graded implant fabrication.
   Objectives: Vascular calcification is accelerated and worsened in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients compared to the general population. Misbalanced phosphate and calcium metabolism plays an important role in this health burden in CKD. In this study the role of phosphate and calcium in inducing medial vascular calcification is researched. Methods: Rat aortic rings were incubated in the normal and calcifying mediums for seven days. Three independent experiments, three rings per condition in each, were performed (N=9). Normal medium consisted of DMEM with 0.9 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium. Calcium medium (Ca) consisted of 4.0 mM calcium and 0.9 mM phosphate; phosphate medium (P) of 2.8 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium; and calciumphosphate medium (Ca+P) of 4.0 mM calcium and 2.8 mM phosphate. Histochemical von Kossa staining was performed, and calcification area of a medial and adventitial section of the aorta was calculated. The results were compared using a two-way ANOVA test. Results: Von Kossa stainings and evaluations of the calcified area demonstrated increased calcification in aortic rings incubated in different calcification mediums, whereas the calcification takes part in different sections of the aorta. Calcium alone causes calcification in the adventitia, phosphate alone in the medial section of the aorta. Combination of both leads to extensive calcification in the adventitia and media. Discussion: In dialysis patients, serum calcium levels are maintained quite well, but serum phosphate levels may exceed suggested levels multiple times. The results of the study demonstrate that high phosphate level is the trigger of excessive vascular calcification and the control of levels of phosphate in CKD patients is crucially important.
   Objectives: Heterogeneously structured electrospun composite scaffolds have performed well as ECM-mimetic tissue replacements in recent years. In light of this, we present an assessment of amnion derived multipotent stromal cell (aMSC) growth on hybrid polycaprolactone(PCL)-gelatin(G) scaffolds in terms of viability, infiltration depth and metabolic activity. Methods: Four scaffold types were electrospun (150 mu m thick) with different PCL:G ratios and fibre diameter distributions using vertical (V) and horizontal (H) orientations - PCL175V (175 mg/ml, homogenous), PCL125G50H (125:50 mg/ml, homogeneous), PCL125G50V (125:50 mg/ml, heterogeneous), PCL100G75V mg/ml (100:75 mg/ml, heterogeneous). A 7 day live/dead assay and a 15 day infiltration study (depths measured using confocal laser scanning microscope) with aMSCs from Callithrix jacchus were performed. Metabolic activity was measured by MTT assay (7 days). Additionally, gelatin loss during scaffold degradation (30 days) was measured by Raman spectroscopy. Results: In general, PCL-gelatin blends perform better than unblended PCL. PCL125G50V shows the deepest cell infiltration on all days (76.3 +/- 7.1 mu m by day 15). It is also the only sample that shows an increasing trend in metabolic activity from day 1 (0.0436 +/- 0.002) to day 7 (0.0996 +/- 0.009). Raman spectroscopy revealed a significant gelatin loss of 53.44 +/- 6.48 % in PCL100G75V while PCL125G50V showed no significant loss by day 15. Discussion: A combination of heterogeneous fiber morphology and composite polymer content in electrospun scaffolds positively affects cell growth and infiltration. Considerable gelatin swelling during degradation can physically inhibit infiltrating cells. Therefore, choosing the right ratio of PCL:gelatin when designing such scaffolds is key.
   A total artificial heart is used for orthotopic replacement of the native ventricles in cases of irreversible biventricular heart failure resulting either from chronic dilated cardiomyopathy or fulminant acute myocardial infraction. It is essential to find the right indication. There are several surgical options to perform a total artificial heart operation. To prevent therapy-failure it essential to set the right indication for implanting a total artificial heart. In general therapy with a TAH is feasible with good postoperative results. Setting the right clinical frame is crucial for the establishment of a therapy concept.
   Objectives: Although diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in many countries, data about its impact on patient-specific reaction to haemodialysis (HD) is scarce. Models that allow identifying and predicting patient-specific response to HD are in development and their improvement is encouraged by clinicians to obtain suitable decision support systems (DSS). Here, possible correlations between diabetes and alterations in the patient-specific parameters identified by a multi-pool, multi-solute model, developed in our laboratory, are investigated. Methods: Data acquired during the 'DialysIS' Interreg Project (141 patients, 4 centres, 1276 HD) have been used. For each patient, a set of specific parameters was identified: one modulates the permeability at the capillary wall (rho), the others account for altered transport of catabolites and electrolytes at the cellular wall (k(i)) and at the dialyser membrane (eta(i)), where '(i)' indicates different solutes. Patients have been classified as diabetic (D) or not (ND) and among Ds, as insulin-dependent (D_ID) or not (D_NID). Initial glucose concentrations and identified values of rho, ki, eta i in the different groups have been compared using proper statistical tests (p<0.01). Results: There were were 37 (26,4%) D patients and 16 of them were D_ID (43,2%). Initial plasma glucose concentration statistically differs both between D and ND and between D_ID and D_NID patients. Among the patient-specific parameters rho, and K-Na, K-Mg, K-Creatinine and K-Bicarbonate results were different between D and ND. The values of eta(Na), eta(Mg), eta(Ca), eta(Urea) and eta(Creatinine), instead, significantly differ between D_ID and D_NID. Discussion: Diabetes-induced autonomic and peripheral neuropathies can justify the finding of altered capillary wall permeability in D; moreover the use of insulin, protein based, seems to impact on the mass transport through the dialyzer membrane. The proposed approach allows adding a new tile to the studies on how the diabetic pathology affects the response to the HD treatment.
   Objectives: Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) therapy has become an accepted treatment for end-stage heart-failure. While patient management has improved over the past decades, limitations in caregiver resources necessitate efficient allocation. Decisions on the optimal setting of LVAD support currently occurs in intervals ranging from a few weeks to a few months. However, the optimal setting for LVAD support may change multiple times per minute. Thus, automation is the only viable solution to this problem. Physiological control promises to integrate the cardiac assist device into patient physiology even more closely, reacting to varying demands or specifying the load for training of the heart muscle. One important design consideration is the choice of feedback variable. Methods: Literature of the past two decades was collected and the presented physiological control concepts were clustered into categories corresponding to functional similarity of feedback variables. Results: It was found that most literature could be summarized into five categories. Control algorithms either used preload, heart rate, ventricular contraction, or afterload as feedback variables or modified the flowrate/headpressure relation. Discussion: Each of these categories contains information about the cardiac state. While preload variables, most closely resemble the native functioning of the left ventricle, they are inherently difficult to measure without using additional sensors. Chronotropic incompetence might be a limiting factor for heart rate based control. Ventricular functioning might fluctuate over time due to changes in inotropy while afterload is heavily regulated by other autoregulatory mechanisms. The headpressure/flowrate relation suffers from uncertainty regarding the origin of pressure changes. Combining elements of these five categories into one control concept might prove beneficial, as different information could be extracted for the controller, which could then be tuned by the physician.
   Objectives: Current understanding of membrane performance in hemodialysis implies that their permeability in terms of molecular weight cut-off must be restricted to a figure below the molecular weight of albumin, i.e. < 60.000. Nephrologists commonly request a maximal allowable albumin loss during a 4h treatment to be below 4g per session. Methods: Recent investigations have shown that the 3D-conformation of albumin is unstable and changes in e.g., uremia or liver failure. Thus, detoxification efficiency of albumin may decrease by about 70% and can be explained by a considerable reduction of albumin's binding constants for both pharmaceutical drugs and uremic retention solutes, as well as for exogenous toxins. As a result, free concentrations of such solutes increase in patient's blood and a higher toxicity is observed. Binding constants for defined uremic retention solutes, such as p-Cresylsulfate, are further affected by the simultaneous presence of other solutes, such as Indoxylsulfate. Results: Oxidative stress, as manifested in many dialysis patients, further promotes changes in albumin conformation. It's thus no surprise, that hemodialysis with protein-permeable membranes improves patient performance, as shown recently in a clinical trial by Nagai et al., (Ther Apher Dial, 2017; 21:378). They reported, that in a 7-year observation period, albumin leakage of 3g or more per HD session provided a better prognosis than albumin leakage less than 3g. Obviously, a clinically acceptable large albumin leakage provides beneficial effects on maintenance HD patients. Discussion: The performance of albumin as an adsorbing protein is inefficient during uremia and liver failure. Due to lower binding constants for pharma-drugs and uremic toxins following conformational changes in the sick state, albumin is unable to perform like in the healthy state. It should, thus, be removed. Identification of 3D-changes of albumin and thus its removal should become a priority.
   Cataract surgery followed by implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in medicine. In 2020 alone, there are expected to be 32 million interventions. Here, ophthalmologists can look back on 70 years of experience. Since there is no blood perfusion at the lens, however, the IOL has a comparatively simple immunological special position. Furthermore, the ophthalmologists also have extensive experience with implants in the cornea, in the chamber angle of the eye and on the retina. In the presentation an overview will be given of the current implants and the necessary regulatory processes. In addition, own experiences (with medical devices) with the new requirements of the MDR will be described.
   Recent evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that post-dilutional haemodiafiltration (HDF) is associated with a benefit in survival. This benefit has been mainly observed in re-analyses of the primary data looking at the patients treated with the highest convection volumes (HCV-HDF). To obtain HCV-HDF, significant pressure has to be applied to the dialyser membrane and the dialysis systems are submitted to significantly stronger transmembrane pressure (TMP) constraints, frequently surpassing the limits proposed by the guidelines. Several automatized systems are proposed to avoid or overcome the alarms induced by the increases in convection and still maintain the volumes prescribed by the physician. The present overview will
   i) Critically analyse the evidence on the effect of convection volumes on survival. ii) Review the automatic systems presently proposed to achieve a given level of convection. iii) Analyse the possible pitfalls in determining the limits established by a dialysis monitor when performing HCV-HDF. iv) Explore a harmonised definition of the parameters that may drive the convection volumes during a dialysis procedure with the aim to help in better defining the Best Practice Guidelines for HCV-HDF.
   Objectives: Human Parvovirus B19 (HPV B19) infection is known to cause pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in kidney transplant recipients. We investigated the diagnosis and prognosis of HPV B19 infection by urine detection in kidney transplant patients with anemia and graft dysfunction. Methods: 1195 recipients (living donor/donation after citizen's death: 492/703) were performed kidney transplant in our center from January 2015 to January 2018. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with HPV B19 infection during follow-up (3.01%, 36/1195). Among those, fourteen HPV B19 infected patients underwent transplanted kidney biopsy, including 12 persons with PRCA and graft dysfunction and 2 recipients with donor-derived HPV B19 infection. We collected the urine samples for detection of HPV B19 DNA copies at the day of kidney biopsy. Meanwhile, the biopsy specimen were studied for immunohistochemical detection by using polyclonal mouse Anti-Parvovirus B19 antibody. Results: The mean diagnosis time of fourteen HPV B19 infected patients was 44 days (7-300days) after transplantation. The reticulocyte percentage was 0.1-0.2% and the mean hemoglobin level was 67 g/L (51-87 g/L). Among 12 biopsies with PRCA and graft dysfunction, 6 were diagnosed with T cell-mediated rejection (IA-IB-IIA), 3 borderline rejection, 2 without rejection signs and 1 was diagnosed with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). The patient, who was diagnosed with TMA, had performed ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. It displayed glomerular microthrombus and diffuse necrosis of renal tubules on renal biopsy. Despite the treatment of IVIG, the graft was ultimately lost. The immunohistochemical result of the TMA biopsy specimen was positive and the others were negative. The result of urine detection for HPV B19 virus DNA copies was >10 boolean AND 5/ml with TMA and the others were negative. Discussion: If the urine test is positive for HPV B19 DNA, parvovirus -associated kidney injury should be suspected.
   Hemodynamic simulations are increasingly used to assess the flow phenomena in intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Based on detailed simulation results existing therapies such as coiling or stenting can be improved or novel approaches are tested. However, the accuracy of patient-specific blood flow acquisitions strongly depends on preliminary and highly interdisciplinary steps. These include for instance medical imaging, image reconstruction, image segmentation and acquisition of appropriate boundary conditions. To assess capabilities, but also limitations of state-of-art IA modeling techniques, international simulation challenges are frequently organized. These comparisons address single or combined steps along the simulation process. Within this talk, the most relevant competitions are presented and the main findings are summarized. In this regard, sources of error in the context of hemodynamic modeling are revealed and the awareness for standardized simulations is sharpened.
   Objectives: Heart failure (HF) is a critical healthcare issue and a primary source of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Globally, it is estimated that up to 100,000 people are candidates for heart transplantation, but only about 5800 transplants were performed in 2016. At Cleveland Clinic, we are developing a continuous-flow total artificial heart (CFTAH) in an attempt to provide a viable alternative to transplantation for the growing population of patients with end-stage HF. Methods: The Cleveland Clinic CFTAH is a double-ended centrifugal pump with only one moving part that is designed to passively self-balance left and right circulations without active intervention. The device has no mechanical bearings to wear out and is driven by an extremely reliable 3-phase brushless, sensorless motor. The nominal external dimensions of the latest version of our adult CFTAH design to be tested in-vivo were 98.4 mm in length, 62 mm in diameter, 160 cc in volume displacement and 486 g in weight without the cable. Results: Biocompatibility of the CFTAH has been demonstrated in two full-term 90-day in vivo tests, completed without the use of any anticoagulation. Since the conclusion of these tests, our team has been working on design improvements to further reduce susceptibility to thrombosis, enhance autoregulation, improve motor controller hardware, add clinically useful features to the control interface and enhance manufacturability. Discussion: Our results to date suggest that a small, mechanically and electronically simple, auto-regulated total artificial heart has significant potential to provide an important clinical option for HF patients.
   We discuss a novel method for hemolysis prediction in computational fluid dynamics, which avoids potential problems inherent to the traditionally used Eulerian and Lagrangian methods. The traditionally used Eulerian method computes a hemolysis index (HI) at the flow outlet by solving a transport partial differential equation (PDE) where the source term equals shear stress raised to some power (which is determined empirically), and then looks at the HI transported to the flow outlet. The largest contribution to HI typically occurs at the flow boundaries (walls), which is precisely the location where numerical noise is most likely to be inadvertently introduced, e.g., from sharp edges in the wall or from low quality mesh elements. This can cause errors in the Eulerian method because its PDE lacks a diffusion term, and consequently any numerical noise is transported to, and accumulates at, the flow outlet surface. We have not seen this potential problem occurring when using a Lagrangian method, although theoretically it could still occur. Regardless, a major disadvantage of the Lagrangian method is a large computational cost required to achieve reasonable accuracy. Instead of using one of the two traditional methods, we use a volume integral where the source term includes both shear stress and flow speed. In situations with sufficient mixing, such as in an LVAD, this approach predicts blood damage at least as well as either of the other methods, for a fraction of the computational cost, and avoids the numerical problems. The method also lends itself better to frozen rotor simulations, while the traditional methods prefer more costly time-dependent simulations. We present an example where the method is used to evaluate potential changes to a HM3-like rotor design.
   Objectives: A great and long pursued goal in cancer research is the development of a suitable culture system for expanding haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which can thereafter be successfully used in transplantations. Since HSCs only reproduce in their natural environment, novel systems try to mimic the in vivo niche of HSCs, the bone marrow, in many factors such as material rigidity, chemical and cellular compositions. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are known to support HSC expansion. This effect is even greater when the cells are cocultured in a 3D environment. The aim of this project is to study the interactions of HSCs and MSCs in a conventional 2D culture compared with a 3D porous hydrogel, which was previously developed in our group. Methods: The influence of HSCs on MSCs and vice versa will be studied on a transcriptomic level by next generation sequencing and verified by qPCR, cytokine arrays and western blots. To regain the cells from the system we want to make our hydrogel degradable by introducing disulfide bonds, which can be cleaved by reducing agents. Afterwards the RNA will be fixed within the cells and these will be separated by magnetic cell sorting, previous to RNA isolation. Results: Previous experiments indicate that the 3D system has a positive effect on HSCs only in coculture with MSCs. With a deep insight into the transcriptomes of both cell types in coculture, we hope to identify key molecules playing a role in this phenomenon and in HSC expansion. Such key molecules shall further be tested for their influence on the coculture by inhibition or enhancement. Discussion: The HSC expansion in vitro while maintaining their stem cell character has been a major and challenging goal in research for more than 60 years. By finding and influencing key molecules of the HSC-MSC interaction, we hope to further develop our 3D hydrogel system and increase HSC expansion in vitro.
   Objectives: Small molecule drugs can be bound to plasma proteins. Examples are Apixaban (459 Da, 87% protein bound), Carvedilol (406 Da, 98% protein bound) or Calcitriol (416 Da, 99.9 % protein bound). In plasma, these drugs have a free and a protein bound fraction. Protein binding impacts the removal behavior of the drug during dialysis. The purpose of this work was to develop a quantitative model to describe the removal of these solutes, and validate the model experimentally. Methods: A mathematical model was developed by coupling the equations of transport in dialyzers reported in one of our previous studies, and mass balance equations reported in literature to include the effect of binding. Simulated HD treatments with human plasma were performed with 3 different types of commercial dialyzers having different membrane permeability to study the removal of Apixaban, Carvedilol or Calcitriol, expressed in terms of solute clearance. Additionally, the loss of albumin was quantified. Results: Experimental clearance results [ml/min] are given as mean +/- MAD from 3 independent experiments in the order of Apixaban / Carvedilol / Calcitriol. Calculated values are reported in brackets. Dialyzer 1 was tested in HDF mode, yielding clearance of 60 +/- 1.0 [61] / 41 +/- 1.8 [10]/ < 6 [0.5]. Dialyzer 2 tested in HD mode yielded clearance of 60 +/- 1.6[ 60] / 31 +/- 1.6 [10] / Discussion: Clearance of tested drugs was lower than expected for their nominal molecular weight. The levels scaled Apixaban > Carvedilol >> Calcitriol, which is inverse to their degree of protein binding (Apixaban < Carvedilol << Calcitriol). The degree of protein binding was revealed to be the actual critical determinant, rather than dialyzer design and operational mode. Drug clearance seemed to be driven by the proportion of the free fractions, as is reflected in the model by the increase of clearance for decreasing bound fraction.
   Objectives: In the development of biocompatible materials for biomedical applications, the foreign body response is an important issue. The healing of surrounding tissue often interferes with the function of an implanted biomaterial. Events like protein deposition, hemostasis, inflammation, tissue repair, infections and the encapsulation of the functional part of the implant are the main cause of failure of the implanted device. Methods: In this study biocompatible nanofilms are produced by means of a plasma polymerization process using a low-pressure magnetron-enhanced 15 kHz glow discharge. This process allows the precise control of the film nature and behaviour. The resulting hydrocarbon film has a thickness of a few nanometer and keeps therefore the inherent properties of the substrate material. Measurements on protein adsorption gave the possibility to tailor the thin films in the needed direction. This means to tailor a native secondary structure of in situ adsorbed proteins. Results: The nanofilms were investigated using different surface analytical methods. Also the interaction in contact with different biological sample materials was tested in-vitro. The precise measurement of the adsorbed proteins indicated a native secondary structure of proteins on these surfaces. Different in-vivo sensor dummies which are in contact with blood and soft-tissue were coated by these nanofilms. The explanted sensors were kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. This stands in good correlation with the measurement of adsorbed proteins. Discussion: The first in-vitro results of the adsorption of blood proteins indicated already a very biocompatible character of these nanofilms. The explanted sensors were kept free of any encapsulation by this coating. These coatings can open the door for many new applications in the field of new implants but also other biomedical products.
   Objectives: Human placenta tissue has great advantages to be used as tissue source due to its molecular composition and its availability as clinical waste product. In our previous studies, human placenta arteries were decellularized and showed low immunogenicity and a supportive environment for cell migration and proliferation. Decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels are a widely-used tool in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. To create placental ECM hydrogel (pECM-HG) decellularized arterial grafts were further processed by an enzymatic pepsin digestion. Methods: pECM-HG were biochemically analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize fiber structures. Cell adherence and migration assays were carried out on pECM-HG coated culture plates to confirm cytocompatibility of the material. As next step pECM-HG was used for coating of vascular grafts in a reseeding experiment using a perfused 3D bioreactor system. Furthermore, biomechanical properties of 3D hydrogels were tested by rheological measurements. Results: pECM-HG showed low amount of DNA residuals and preservation of cell interacting ECM proteins. SEM analysis revealed the formation of specific fibrous structures, dependent on respective hydrogel concentration. Cell binding and viability assays showed significantly enhanced cell adherence and increased proliferation rates when seeded on surfaces coated with pECM-HG (p<0.001) compared to controls. pECM-HG showed beneficial properties for cell reseeding on acellular vascular grafts in a flow bioreactor system. Discussion: We developed a hydrogel from human vascular tissue that is cytocompatible and supports cell adherence and proliferation. We hypothesize that this hydrogel has great potential due to its origin and composition. Further investigations on the hydrogel composition are ongoing. It is planned use the pECM-HG for 3D cell printing applications or as injectable hydrogel to support ischemic injury regeneration.
   Objectives: Intra-aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) is undoubtedly the most widely used mechanical circulatory support system for a range of severe heart failure indications. Average duration of IABP use is 1-3 days, however its longer-term use has not been adequately studied. The objective of this work is to establish the extent to which the IABP duration has been used, and also to examine the clinical outcome pertaining to prolonged use of IABP, using meta-analysis of literature data. Methods: We defined IABP prolonged use as 7 days or longer; a choice based on a duration that is greater than double the current perceived average use. We systematically reviewed the literature (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science) and identified 14 studies that have prolonged IABP use between 1968 - 2018. Patients indications included heart failure (refractory, congestive, end stage), ventricular arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock. Results: A total number of 1707 patients of both genders received prolonged IABP use with an overall average of 22.6 days. The studied cohort is split into: Group 1: n= 1683 adults, mean age 57.9 years, range 19-84 years old, average use of 21.2 days. Survival rate in this group was 64.4%. Group 2: n=24 infants and children, mean age 5.5 years, range 7 days-17.5 years old, average use 24 days. Overall mean survival rate to discharge was 62.5%. At a mean follow-up of 85 months, all 15 survivors were alive and well. Discussion: Due to its ease of insertion and relative low cost, IABP presents the first port of call in a wide range of heart failure scenarios. This analysis indicates that, age does not seem to be a significant parameter that affect outcomes of IABP long-term use. Although, IABP is perceived to be only a short-term support, its prolonged use is evident with successful outcomes. Further trials of IABP long-term use for children and adults is warranted to further establish the range of indications IABP can be utilised as a long-term support.
   Objectives: Human serum albumin (HSA), one of the dominating proteins in human plasma with its exceptional binding capacity plays an important role in storing and transporting different substances throughout the human circulatory system. Clinically used to treat a variety of diseases, particularly in liver failure therapy, pharmaceutical-grade HSA contains high amounts of stabilizers, such as Na-caprylate and N-acetyltryptophanate. These compounds represent potential risks to patients with restricted liver function. The aim of this study was to test if the elimination of stabilizers by adsorbent technique affects HSA's secondary structure. Methods: Albumin infusion solutions (BIOMED, Germany) were filtered using a commercial system Hepalbin (Albutec, Germany). Raman- and FTIR spectroscopy as well as DSC analysis were applied to analyze conformational changes in treated and untreated HSA samples. For Raman based studies different parameters such as object slides type, integration time, accumulations number and laser capacity were investigated. Results: Preliminarily results of the physical-chemical analyses showed some differences for filtered samples in comparison to the unfiltered ones. Raman and FTIR spectra exhibited both, peak shifts in characteristic HSA amide bands and an alteration in the peaks' shape. DSC thermograms revealed significant differences in denaturation temperatures of the compared samples. Discussion: A Raman shift in amide I band and changes in the alpha-helix/beta-sheet ratio detected via FTIR spectroscopy indicated a possible alteration in the HSA conformation after filtration. These findings were corroborated by DCS showing a tendency towards lower denaturation temperatures in samples after stabilizers removal. The results may contribute to finding a compromise between stability and high functional performance of HSA for the improvement of liver failure therapy.
   Objectives: The protein fibrinogen is important in blood coagulation and wound healing. Hence, nanofibrous fibrinogen scaffolds are highly attractive as biomaterials. One currently used technique to prepare fibrinogen nanofibers in vitro is electrospinning. Since this technique uses organic solvents and high electric fields, which can impede the biological protein function, we have developed a novel technique to prepare fibrinogen scaffolds with physiological buffers. Methods: We introduced the novel method of salt-induced self assembly under controlled drying conditions to prepare nanofibrous fibrinogen scaffolds. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to characterize the fiber morphology. We studied the secondary structure with Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. To assess the biocompatibility of our novel scaffolds we analyzed the proliferation of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts with WST1 assays and studied the cell morphology with SEM. Results: Salt-induced self assembly reproducibly yielded fibrinogen nanofibers with overall scaffold dimensions in the centimeter range. SEM analysis revealed fiber diameters between 200 and 300 nm. By adding a customized fixation step after the fiber formation we fabricated either immobilized or free-standing fibrinogen networks depending on the underlying substrate material. With FTIR spectroscopy we found a higher content of beta-sheet structures for fibrinogen nanofibers in comparison to planar fibrinogen. 3T3 fibroblasts were found to proliferate well on fibrinogen nanofibers with cell numbers comparable to planar fibrinogen substrates. SEM analysis showed that 3T3 fibroblasts grew in close contact with fibrinogen nanofibers. Discussion: Our new self assembly process offers a well controllable and physiological biofabrication method for large-scale fibrinogen scaffolds. Based on the good biocompatibility results our fibrinogen networks are very promising candidates for a new class of wound dressings.
   Total artificial hearts (TAH) are used to restore quality of life to biventricular heart failure patients but can also introduce significant risks. Several features were included in to the BiVACOR design to mitigate some of the major risks, such as 1) device malfunction, 2) insufficient hemocompatibility, 3) ineffective physiological interaction, and 4) inappropriate device geometry. To achieve a durable design the BiVACOR TAH reduces mechanical wear by levitating a single rotating impeller in a magnetic field. To reduce the incidence of single fault failures, the levitation and drive systems incorporate backup features. Large clearance gaps in the blood flow path and cyclic speed variations assist hemocompatibility. Physiological interaction is improved via autonomous left/right outflow balancing, the ability to inherently adapt total outflow based on physiological conditions, and to respond to variations in filling volumes. Initial durability testing is ongoing with no device failures after 180 days. The redundant motor and hydrodynamic backup bearing maintain hemodynamic function when failure modes are induced. Preliminary NIH, platelet activation and vWF degradation during in-vitro tests show lower levels than implantable VADs. In-vivo results (1x90day, 3x30-day) confirm benchtop observations. When operated with either pulsatile or non-pulsatile outflow up to 15 l/min, or with the hydrodynamic backup bearing, pfHb ranged between 0.5-2mg/dL. The system can balance outflows under a wide variety of physiological conditions, while inherently adjusting flows by more than 4 l/min. Finally, device weight and size allowed a good anatomical fit in human cadavers with BSA >1.4m(2). By implementing the risk mitigating design features, the BiVACOR device aims to provide patients with a durable, hemocompatible, and physiological interactive TAH with suitable anatomical fit. Successful development of this device may ultimately lead to a long-term alternative to heart transplants.
   Objectives: Visualization of hemodynamics often represents a simplification of blood as a monophasic fluid. In this study, blood is used as a multiphase fluid. The aim is to fabricate artificial blood to visualize hemodynamics with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). More specific, micro beads (ArtErys), which mimic the erythrocytes, are fabricated with a membrane-emulsion-technology system (MET). This system is developed and compared with the results (e.g. ArtEry size) of three other methods: microfluidic, electro-spraying and air flow. Methods: The ArtErys are made of hydrogels (Agarose 0.3-0.7 wt.%) to match refractive index and biomechanics. For PIV tracking, particles (Sphericals (c), 20 mu m) are encapsulated directly into the ArtErys and are not added to the plasma where they might affect the hemodynamics. For the MET system, different oils (e.g. paraffin) are used as disperse phase. The Agarose/PIV mixture is pumped (50 to 100 ml/h) into a constant oil flow (5 to 40 ml/h) through a PTFE membrane (Reichelt Chemietchnik GmbH, pore size 60 mu m). The ArtErys are created during this process and transported away by the oil. The MET process is carried out in a heated water bath with a temperature of 55 degrees C. Results: The ArtEry size depends mainly on two parameters: the flow rate of the agarose/PIV solution and the flow rate of the oil. A flow rate of 80 ml/h Agarose/PIV solution leads to smallest bead sizes with a mean diameter of 150 mu m. High rates lead to merging of the ArtErys, which is reflected in a larger diameter. Furthermore, the bead size depends on the parameter oil flow rate. Here, a rate of 30 ml/h leads to the smallest beads. Discussion: The MET method has been successfully implemented to fabricate ArtErys with encapsulated PIV particles. Compared to the other methods, the MET system fabricates the biggest ArtEry sizes (MET: 150 mu m, microfluidic: 15 mu m, electro-spraying: 80 mu m, air flow: 100 mu m).
   Objectives: Since the latest revision of the Medical Devices (MDs) Directive, the European regulatory framework considers stand-alone software as a MD per se, as confirmed by the MD Regulation. The recent surge of AI tools, which promise to be ubiquitous soon, poses problems relative to their certification as MDs. In view of the already granted market approval in Europe and the USA for some AI-based MDs, we aimed to investigate the main relevant issues of such MDs' regulation. Methods: Unlike traditional SW as MDs, for which established standards already exist (e.g., IEC 62304, "Software life-cycle processes"), for AI tools there are very few specific standards. The definition of AI, or intelligence itself, is by no means universally accepted. Thus, we limited the scope of AI to Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL). Results: 1) ML/DL tools are data intensive, so that a critical issue is how to construct a representative set of input data. E.g., IEC 62304 recommends that the manufacturer include software system inputs and outputs, in the SW requirements: this is clearly too generic for a DL tool. 2) Guidelines for acceptable input data size should be drawn, for a given system/software architecture. Moreover, quality check of training data should always be executed, before SW training. Quality of ML/DL tools and of physical architecture is also relevant. 3) Generally, DL tools lack an explicit declarative knowledge representation, hence it is difficult or impossible to assess to "reasoning" behind the algorithmic decisions. "Explainable" AI should be the standard, in order to rule out fuzziness in machine clinical decision making and impossibility to pinpoint the problem(s), in view of the legal responsibility for MD use. It has been found that DL performance conflicts with explainability, thus priority setting will be crucial. Discussion: The regulatory treatment of AI-based MDs needs improvements, in order to have safe and effective products, as well as wider societal acceptance.
   Objectives: The aim of this work is to design a reliable and efficient sheath for an implantable part of a device for the wireless inductive powering of artificial organs. Methods: Wireless inductive power transfer can help get rid of the problems of recharge and wired constant power supply to artificial organs. However, the design of the implantable part of the transcutaneous powering device, or so-called assembly, is complicated by the lack of a comprehensive solution of technical and medical problems. The assembly must be encapsulated in the sheath which requires the choice of a biocompatible and non-magnetic material. This eliminates the formation of eddy currents on the sheath, whereby negative influence on the energy transfer is minimized. At the same time, the material should have a low thermal conductivity (about 0.5 W / (m . K)) to prevent overheating of the tissue from the circuitry. The sheath of the assembly must have sufficient durability to protect the circuitry. The form-factor of the sheath should be minimized for the convenience of the patient (dimensions in the limit of 20 x 20 x 3 mm). Results: The sheath was developed for the assembly prototype. The assembly provides an output power in the range 0.45 horizontal ellipsis 0.55 W for the axial distance between the coils in the range 10 horizontal ellipsis 20 mm and the lateral misalignment up to 20 mm. The calculation and measurement were performed in the air and with the samples of "skin-fat" biological objects, in order to determine and verify the sheath characteristics. Discussion: We have developed and tested the assembly's sheath for inductive powering of artificial organs that meets technical and medical requirements.
   Objectives: Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are used in medicine for targeted drug delivery to the area of cancer. There is the problem of remotely determining in vivo concentrations of MNPs. The aim of our work was to experimentally test acoustomagnetic method (AMM) for detecting MNPs in a model sample of a biological substance (BS). Methods: A colloidal solution of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in a mixture of oleic acid and kerosene was used as a model sample. The weight concentration of the MNPs in the solution was 0.15%, and the viscosity of the solution was close to the blood viscosity. To detect MNPs in solution, a special experimental setup was developed. The installation consists of an ultrasound generator, a permanent magnet, a glass container with a solution, an induction multi-turn coil near the glass tube, and a voltmeter as a measure of the voltage across the coil. Ultrasound causes periodic movement of the particles of the solution together with the MNPs along the container axis. The magnet orients the MNPs in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the container. As a result, the summation of MNPs creates an alternating magnetic field with an ultrasonic frequency in the coil area. An alternating voltage (U) arises on the coil, as measured by a voltmeter. Results: As measurements have shown, the magnitude of the voltage is proportional to the concentration of MNPs in the field of action of the ultrasound and the magnet field, as well as the intensity of the ultrasound. In particular, when the intensity of ultrasound was at the level of 0.02 W/ cm2, U = 1mV was obtained. Discussion: The experimental results are consistent with the calculated estimates and suggest that AMM can be used to detect MNPs in a real BS. Considering that the magnitude of the constant magnetic field in these experiments was 0.1T, we can also conclude that this method is safe, more accurate, and easier to implement than traditional X-ray and MRT methods.
   Objectives: For a single hemodialysis session several hundred liters of water are consumed. Water scarcity and inadequate water purification facilities worsen contamination risk especially in developing countries. Here, we investigate the application of a mixed matrix membrane (MMM), which combines filtration and adsorption, for achieving endotoxin-free dialysate combined to high removal of uremic toxins from human plasma. Methods: We investigate the adsorption of lipo-polysacharide (LPS) by a MMM in both static and dynamic conditions. Dynamic adsorption of LPS is also investigated in presence of uremic toxins in human plasma. Diffusion experiments using dialysate contaminated with bacterial culture filtrates are also performed to assess the ability of the MMM to act as a safety-barrier to avoid transfer of pyrogens to the plasma. A membrane without sorbents is used as control and the obtained results are compared with literature studies using current dialysis membranes. Results: The MMM can remove approximately 10 times more endotoxins from dialysate compared to commercial dialysis membranes. No transfer of pyrogens was detected in the blood compartment, revealing safety-barrier properties of the MMM. Importantly, endotoxins from dialysate and protein-bound toxins from human plasma can be removed simultaneously without compromising AC adsorption capacity. Discussion: We estimate that 0.15 m(2)of MMM is needed to remove the daily production of the protein-bound toxins, indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid and to completely remove endotoxins in a wearable artificial kidney (WAK) device. Future studies would focus on the applicability of the MMM in wearable/portable artificial kidneys and in general for home-hemodialysis treatments.
   Objectives: Nearly half of all heart failure patients suffer from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). With no effective treatment, a major clinical need is presented. The aim of this study was the hemo - and fluid dynamic investigation of a valveless pulsatile pump for HFpEF using in-vitro, ex-vivo, computational fluid dynamic (CFD), and 4D flow MRI imaging studies. Methods: The pump is a pneumatically driven pulsatile pump with a single valveless cannula that is to be implanted through the LV apex and is operated synchronously with the left ventricle. A prototype of the proposed pump system was fabricated. The pump was tested in an in-vitro hybrid mock loop system to evaluate its hemodynamic effect in four HFpEF phenotypes. Further hemodynamic evaluation was conducted by implanting the pump in an ex-vivo isolated heart model. CFD was employed for flow field analysis of two different pump designs-a symmetric and an asymmetric configuration. The results were validated by 4D flow MRI imaging of the respective prototypes. Results: In the in-vitro studies, the pump augmented cardiac output (CO) by 14 - 30% and reduced left atrial pressure (LAP) by 14 - 30%. Ex-vivo studies showed the similar hemodynamic trends: augmented CO by 20.0 +/- 9.7%, and reduced LAP by 57.5 +/- 14.4%. Fluid dynamic simulations revealed good correlation with the respective 4D flow measurements. The asymmetric configuration disclosed superior fluid dynamic performance with 94.5% of the initial blood being exchanged after 3 beats. Discussion: It was demonstrated that the valveless pulsatile device can improve hemodynamics in HFpEF patients by augmenting CO and reducing LAP. Appropriate washout of the pump chamber is achieved by a persisting vortex evolving within the asymmetric design throughout each pump cycle. By demonstrating the hemodynamic effects and promising fluid dynamic performance of the pump, feasibility of the system as a potential treatment option for HFpEF patients is supported.
   Objectives: In this work, the denaturation behaviour of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) aqueous nanodispersions during heating was analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry. Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction with SWCNTs have been discussed. The calculation procedure for estimating the parameters of laser treatment on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry data is presented. Accurate calculation of the optimal parameters of laser treatment, under which there is complete denaturation of albumin and the solid nanocomposite material is forming, will minimize the thermal damage of the connected tissues, while not reducing the tensile strength of the seam. Methods: Laser solders based on water dispersion of BSA (25 % w/w) and SWCNTs (0, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 % w/w) were used for differential scanning calorimetry study. Studies were conducted in hermetically sealed crucibles with heating rates of 3, 5, 10 and 20 degrees C/min. Results: The specific energies and denaturation temperatures of the laser solders were measured. The use of SWCNTs led to a decrease in the specific energy of denaturation from 4.11 to 3.27 J/g and a denaturation temperature from 87.2 to 86.9 degrees C. The activation energy of albumin denaturation in laser solder has doubled during use SWCNTs Discussion: Thermodynamic effects of BSA interaction with SWCNTs have been discussed, namely the changes in temperature characteristics of denaturation processes and the partial thermal destabilization of albumin. The energetic parameters of laser treatment have been estimated on the basis of differential scanning calorimetry data. The values obtained are optimal for complete BSA denaturation resulting in formation of solid nanocomposite material with minimal thermal damage of the connected tissues and sufficient tensile strength of the seam.
   Objectives: Clot formation in the membrane oxygenator is a serious complication in long-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In the blood vessels, nitric oxide (NO) generated by nitric oxide synthase on the endothelial cells suppresses both aggregation/activation of platelets and adhesion/activation of leukocytes. Therefore, biocompatibility of the membrane oxygenator may be improved by the addition of NO gas to the sweep gas. The objective of the present study was to determine, using a rat ECMO model, whether addition of NO gas to the blood can suppress blood coagulation. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 350 to 400 g were used for the experiments. After the rats were anesthetized, extracorporeal circulation was established by guiding the blood from the right jugular vein into the left femoral vein. Heparin was administered by bolus injection (0.7 unit/g-rat) only at the start of the ECMO. Polymethyl pentene membranes were used for the oxygenator. The sweep gas (NO: 0, 100 or 200 ppm, O2: 30%, CO2: 5%, N2: balance) was added to the blood via the oxygenator. During the experiment, the arterial pressure, oxygenator inlet pressure, venous pressure, activated whole blood clotting time (ACT), and methemoglobin (Met-Hb) concentration were measured. After circulation, the hemoglobin (Hb) content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the eluate from the residual blood in the oxygenator were measured. Results: Extracorporeal circulation was stably performed for 4 hours. There were no differences in the ACT during the experiment among the three groups. The amount of Met-Hb was below 10% in the NO group. The Hb content and LDH activity in the eluate were significantly lower in the 200-ppm NO group than those in the 0 ppm NO. Discussion: The amount of Met-Hb in the NO group indicates that there is no adverse effect related to Met-Hb. The Hb content and LDH activity indicate that the NO contained in the sweep gas inhibited blood coagulation in this rat extracorporeal circulation model.
   Objectives: Data from the WAA apheresis registry was investigated regarding patients treated with extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) as a tool to modulate immune response in various diseases. Methods: 381 patients (34% women) had been treated with ECP for a total of 10668 procedures. The mean age was 48 years (+/- 18, range 3-81 years). Estimation of quality of life was made using grade 0 (suicidal) up to 10 (best ever) and health quality grade 1 (Bed ridden, ICU condition) up to 10 (athletic). Adverse events were analyzed. ANOVA comparisons were used. Results: Most patients were treated due to graft versus host disease (GVHD, n=284) and other hematological diseases (n=34). Adverse events were registered in 5.8% of the first treatments and in 2.1% of the subsequent procedures. Severe adverse events were present in 0.4% of all procedures. No patient died due to the procedure. Tingling and stitching were the most common side effects. For those with GVHD the QoL was initially at a mean 6.3 (+/- 1.5, range 2-10) and improved significantly within 10 procedures and the Health Condition estimate improved significantly within 9 procedures and improved further with added procedures. Discussion: Photopheresis is an established therapy with few side effects. The present data indicate that approximately 10 procedures are necessary to note significant effect to GVHD.
   Objectives: The most fundamental goal in improving quality of care in hospitals is to eliminate unnecessary deaths. AIM: Three-year mortality and quality of care between 2015-2017 were evaluated in a tertiary nephrology clinic. Methods: Audit of 392 deaths was carried out to reveal prevalence of suboptimal clinical observations. Admission pressure, direct admissions avoiding public healthcare system, severity of clinical conditions, elderly persons dying in the hospital, time of admissions and death were evaluated. Results: In 2015 and 2016, 5.5 of every 100 inpatients died in the hospital, and this proportion decreased to 4.9 in 2017, with high percentage of patients who died in the first 24 or 48 hours from admission. The percentage of hospital deaths occurring in combination with AKI rose from 17% up to 37% over the three-year study period. Many patients who died with worsening CKD, were not ever referred to a nephrologist. More than half of patients were admitted on duty and died over weekends. About 5% of the hospital deaths were among patients aged 85 and over, and in 2017 that number rose up to 10%. Patients who died were seriously ill, at least 17% had malignancy. Most of the cardiovascular deaths were directly caused by ischemic stroke. Discussion: In this study we did not find patients with preventable deaths. The results indicated that patients were seriously ill, elderly, some being admitted to hospital to die. Some of the patients were kept long period prior to death because of shortage on certain facilities. There is admission pressure and other external factors contributing to high burden in treatment of the dying patients. Still, further effors are necessary for further providing and auditing health quality of care.
   Objectives: Human immune cells have been produced using Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP) guidelines and have been tested in clinical studies for a number of diseases, for which still no or only inadequate alternative therapies are available. Examples include several cancer entities, stroke, myocardial infarction, severe autoimmune disorders and chronic infections. Despite many in vitro or in animal studies report positive outcomes after immune cell therapy, convincing results showing the benefits of ATMP in clinical studies are rare. Part of this discrepancy in the outcome of the clinical studies in comparison to the in vitro and in animal studies may be caused by the manufacturing of immune cells for clinical trials. Cells prepared for clinical trials were mostly manufactured using archaic, scarcely controlled and incomparable production processes and stringent analytical methods for assessing proliferation and differentiation of the immune cells during the manufacturing process were not applied. Methods: The production of ATMPs is first of all dependent on the donor specific biology, which significantly varies from one donor or patient, respectively, to another (biological heterogeneity). In case of immune cell therapy, the manufacturing process is key for cytotoxic function and is the basis for the biological activity of the cells after injection into the patient. Results: The challenge for future clinical trials therefore is to reproducibly provide a sufficient number of biologically active cells of appropriate quality preferably in accordance with quality manufacturing guidelines (e. g. Good Manufacturing Practice, ICH etc.). Only using cells which have been produced under these rigorous quality control regimes will allow the conduction of clinically meaningful trials. Discussion: The talk presents a survey and discusses consequences on future requirements for manufacturing processes of products for immune cell therapies.
   Objectives: Cryopreservation plays a major role in the storage of tissues that are kept for subsequent transplantation. A wide variety of tissues intended for transplantation for a patient are stored in this way. In addition to the assignment to a suitable recipient, it must be ensured in particular that a sufficiently long period of time is available for infection diagnostic analyses. Cryopreservation of tissue is therefore routine in everyday tissue medicine. Methods: As is well known, the success of low temperature storage depends in particular on coordinated freezing and storage processes, in the optimization of which many research approaches have already been investigated. In contrast to these well-known principles of important parameter adjustment in this context, little attention is paid to optimizing the freezing process in the daily routine of tissue medicine. In fact, for some applications the suboptimal storage of tissue is not critical, as no vital cells are necessary or desired. Results: This reduces the process to a minimum and eliminates the need for additives such as cryoprotective agent (CPA) or animal/human serum. This is particularly important for tissue preparations which, as in Germany, require a medicinal product approval by a competent authority. Any change to the process must be first approved by the competent authority, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut (PEI). Optimizing the freezing process would therefore entail a new approval procedure. If the changed process was not previously known in the EU, a clinical study is also required. Discussion: For this reason, the conditions are not improved in case of doubt, although it is known that this could lead to a higher quality of the tissue after thawing. Less toxic CPA could simplify the approval procedure and thus contribute to improved tissue storage for transplantation. The same applies to the cryopreservation of tissue engineered products.
   Vascular access is a key issue for survival for uremic patients that need acute or chronic dialysis. In acute settings the use of central venous catheters, holding two luminae, are most commonly used in the intensive care for continuous or intermittent hemodialysis. Such catheters may be of acute type or a chronic type containing a separate cuff to limit bacterial invasion into the vessels. Another option is to place a peritoneal dialysis catheter into the abdominal cavity. If using the right technique, this catheter can be surgically inserted in local anesthesia and could be used directly postoperatively for acute but also chronic peritoneal dialysis. For chronic hemodialysis (HD) the preferable option is to place an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) at the lower arm. This results in enlargement of the vein, and partly fibrosis, that allows for frequent punctures leaving no material externalized after the end of a HD procedure. A problem is the development of vascular stenosis and thrombosis that need interventions in at least 50% of patients within one year. When the AVF fails an option is to insert a graft (AVG). This may be either a biologic or synthetic graft interpositioned between the feeding artery and a more proximal vein below the elbow instead of the local vein that usually is occluded. If this option even fails, the patient has to rely on a sufficient permanent central dialysis catheter where complication such as bacterial contamination and occlusions are problems. To avoid such catheters a dream for future would be a graft as AV access that is made of an autologous biodegradable material that has physiological characteristics that prevent stenosis and clotting and also is possible to easy correct in its diameter to adjust for the volume of blood returned/minute to the heart to avoid congestive heart failure.
   Objectives: It has been observed that the in-vivo dialyser clearance for small solutes is not constant during a hemodialysis (HD) session. This may influence the choice of the value to be measured and reported. We investigated the presence of trends in the clearances of urea and creatinine, and how it impacts their values. Methods: Diffusive clearances were calculated for urea and creatinine from dialysate concentration data measured in 25 patients who underwent 3 consecutive HD sessions each. Clearance values were obtained for each hour (at 0, 60, 120, 180, 240 minutes). The significance of the observed trend in the data was statistically tested, as was any difference between the values at 2 and 3 hours, and the average clearance during the session. Results: Urea clearance showed an overall increase from the start of HD (by +10.1 +/- 19.3 mL/min, p = 0.0002) while creatinine clearance decreased (by -30.7 +/- 17.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). For urea, there was, however, a significant increase during the first hour (by +26.5 +/- 16.3 mL/min, p < 10(-4)) which was not observed for creatinine. Starting from 2 hours, both clearances decreased significantly, but the overall drop for creatinine was twice that for urea (by -34.1 +/- 15.7 vs. -16.3 +/- 19.8 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). As a consequence of these different trends, clearance at 2 h, 3 h, and the time-average clearance were not significantly different for urea (199.2 +/- 25.9 mL/min, p = 0.18), whereas they were so for creatinine (2 h: 115.9 +/- 26.3 mL/min vs. 3 h: 106.2 +/- 29.2 mL/min vs. average: 109.7 +/- 26.1 mL/min, p < 10(-4)). Discussion: A decrease in clearance during HD can be expected because of the progressive clogging of the dialyzer membrane's pores. It is not clear however the reason for the higher decrease in creatinine compared to urea. Our results suggest anyway that the time at which creatinine clearance is measured in-vivo should be clearly reported, as the difference during the session might be as high as 30%.
   Objectives: Currently, there are no reliable internal treatment options for large segmental bone defects. The objective of this study is to develop an alternative treatment for a young male patient with a huge 180mm diaphyseal tibial bone defect, who was already recommended amputation. Methods: A modular add-on system is developed for a commercially available motorized bone lengthening nail (Ellipse Technolo-gies, USA). The system allows bifocal segmental transport of osteotomized bone segments. By this, the bone defect is filled from two sides. A wire rope hoist shall ensure that the bone can overcome the distance from both sides, which re-duces the time of healing and the amount of implanted parts. A 3D-printed model of the patient's bone segments helps to design the implant system itself and the handling which includes fixation, transport and explantation. Results: The results show in accordance to previous studies that the developed implant system effectively transports both osteot-omized transport bone segments. The wire rope hoist mechanism and the modular construction works as planned. The implant system can be explanted successfully. Discussion: In this study, we present an individualized modular add-on implant solution. The advantage of the modular setup is that many parts can be manufactured in universal sizes. This method of bone reconstruction could help many patients, who suffer from large critical size defects.
   Among the various possible embodiments of Advanced Therapies and in particular of Tissue Engineering the use of temporary scaffolds to regenerate tissue defects is one of the key issues. The scaffolds should be specifically designed to create environments that promote tissue development and not merely to support the maintenance of communities of cells. To achieve that goal, highly functional scaffolds may combine specific morphologies and surface chemistry with the local release of bioactive agents. Many biomaterials have been proposed to produce scaffolds aiming the regeneration of a wealth of human tissues. We have a particular interest in developing systems based in biodegradable polymers. Those demanding applications require a combination of mechanical properties, processability, cell-friendly surfaces and tunable biodegradability that need to be tailored for the specific application envisioned. Those biomaterials are usually processed by different routes into devices with wide range of morphologies such as biodegradable fibers and meshes, films or particles and adaptable to different biomedical applications. In our approach, we combine the temporary scaffolds populated with therapeutically relevant communities of cells to generate a hybrid implant. For that we have explored different sources of adult and also embryonic stem cells. We are exploring the use of adult MSCs, namely obtained from the bone marrow for the development autologous-based therapies. We also develop strategies based in extra-embryonic tissues, such as the perivascular region of the umbilical cord (Wharton's Jelly). We are currently involved in a European consortium aiming at developing films with antimicrobial properties to be used in hospitals to cover surfaces that are prone to facilitate the transmission of infections. Those films use surface topographies and natural-derived oils to ensure the needed antibacterial properties to the films. This talk will review our latest developments of functionalized biomaterials and scaffolds in combination with stem cells for advanced biomedical devices and therapies.
   Objectives: Corwave LVAD is being developed to employ gentle oscillation of a membrane to propel blood, based on the wave motion of swimming fish. The pump output can be readily tuned by adjusting membrane oscillation frequency and magnitude. The purpose of this project was to increase the hydraulic efficiency, implement a physiologic pulsatility control algorithm, and confirm performance in animal implants. Methods: The fluid path of the pump was simulated by Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) computational fluid dynamic analysis in COMSOL. Membrane size, oscillation frequency, oscillation magnitude, and the blood flow path were modeled and refined to improve hydraulic performance and eliminate areas of flow stagnation. Pumps were then tested in blood analogs and blood in mock circulation loops and in vitro hemolysis testing. Non-hermetic prototype pumps were implanted in a total of 25 sheep for acute and chronic implants. Results: Design simulations and individual component testing resulted in a pump which can generate 6+ LPM of blood flow against physiologic pressures with maximum shear rates orders of magnitude lower than those of rotary blood pumps. Mock loop testing demonstrated the pumps have "flat" HQ (pressure vs. flow) curves. Three control methods were developed: fixed, asynchronous pulsatile, and synchronous pulsatile. Pulsatile modes generated dP/dt>400 mmHg/s using sensorless detection of native ventricle systole. Animal implants demonstrated low hemolysis and an absence of renal infarcts, but were limited to about a week in duration due to the non-hermetic sealing of the pumps. Discussion: Application of robust computational simulation and bench top testing have produced a unique new kind of VAD, offering the flow capacity and reliability of rotary pumps, but adding physiologically relevant pulsatility without excessive shear rates. Future efforts will implement full hermeticity to extend animal study durations and confirm von Willebrand Factor compatibility.
   Objectives: To investigate the colonization potential of Ovine Endothelial Progenitor Cells (OEPCs) on thermoplastic silicone-based polyurethane (TSPU) polymer under static condition. Methods: Functionalised TSPU (F-TSPU) was prepared by first subjecting the TSPU nonwovens to plasma treatment, followed by sterilization with 70% ethanol for seven minutes and then coupling with VEGF under sterile conditions. TSPU without any additional treatment or modification, identified as NF-TSPU, were used as control. OEPCs were seeded at the density of 5x10(4) cell/cm(2) onto square 4 cm(2) sized polymers under static conditions. Samples were taken at three time points: 1, 3 and 7 days. Samples were examined through live/dead staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to check the progression of cellular colonization on the polymer. MTS assay was used to quantify the metabolic activity of the cells on the polymer. Results: Cells seeded on the polymer surface were clearly visible on the SEM images. On day 3, the cells could be observed as patches on surface but did not cover all the surface. By day 7, the cells had almost filled the polymer surface. In case of F-TSPU, at Day 7, the underlying fiber pattern of the polymer could be observed on the cell sheet covering the polymer. Whereas this feature was not seen for NF-TSPU, indicating that the cells attached firmly to F-TSPU compared to NF-TSPU. Bright green fluorescence was observed on samples that underwent live/dead staining, indicating presence of live cells. Only a few red spots, representing dead cells, were seen. The metabolic activity on NF-TSPU was quantified to be higher than in the F-TSPU, though the difference was not statistically significant. Discussion: Static cell seeding experiments showed that OEPCs were able to attach and grow on the surface of both types of TSPU. These are promising results suggesting that TSPU holds potential for engineering of a new generation of heart valve prostheses, which will be assessed in pre-clinical animal models in the near future.
   Objectives: To investigate the impact of rotational speed modulation on VAD hemodynamics by comparing the effects induced by the artificial pulse in the HeartMate 3 (HM3, Abbott Laboratories, USA) to those induced by the Lavare cycle in the HeartWare HVAD (Medtronic Inc., USA). Methods: We compared the effect of speed modulation to a baseline case with constant speed and pressure head in both HM3 and HVAD using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulations employed high spatial (10(7) elements) and temporal (2 degrees per time step) resolution and one-way coupling to a lumped parameter model (LPM) of the cardiovascular system for physiologic boundary conditions. Lagrangian particle tracking was implemented to probe viscous and total stresses along cell paths. Results were validated against experimental pressure-flow (HQ) curves. Results: LPM results showed that HM3 and HVAD follow drastically different HQ loops during speed modulation, reflecting differences in pump characteristics, modulation rate and magnitude and associated fluid inertial effects. In the HM3, pump flow varied between -1.2 and 8.8 L/min during the artificial pulse vs. 3.7 to 7.1 L/min in the HVAD during the Lavare cycle. Induced aortic pressure pulses were comparable (11.3 vs 13.2 mmHg). CFD results revealed higher baseline shear stresses in the HVAD than in the HM3, coherent with previous studies. In both pumps, stresses were highest during flow acceleration. Sudden flow deceleration during the artificial pulse destabilized the flow and thereby also increased turbulence and total stresses on particles. Discussion: While speed modulation may contribute to pump wash out and pulsatility, it may also increase flow disturbances and shear. By relating shear stress to the rate and magnitude of the speed changes, this study sheds light on the impact of the imposed accelerations on the stress fields. This is of relevance for the establishment of both built-in and physiologically-controlled speed modulation sequences.
   Objectives: Thrombotic deposition is a major consideration in the development of implantable cardiovascular devices. Recently, it has been demonstrated that fluid mechanical shear micro-gradients play a critical role in thrombogenesis. The goal of the present work is to develop a predictive computational model of platelet activation and deposition that can be used to assess the thrombotic burden of cardiovascular devices. We have developed a comprehensive model of platelet-mediated thrombogenesis which includes platelet transport in the blood flow, platelet activation induced by both agonists generated at sites of vascular injury and shear micro-gradients, kinetics and mechanics of platelet adhesion, and changes in the local fluid dynamics due to the growth of a thrombus. Methods: A 2D computational model was developed using the multi-physics finite element solver COMSOL 5.3a. The model can be described by a coupled set of convection-diffusion-reaction equations, and it comprises 7 species: resting and activated platelets, agonists that induce thrombosis, and an anticoagulant agent. Platelet adhesion at the surface was modeled via flux boundary conditions. Using a moving mesh for the surface, thrombus growth and consequent alterations in blood flow were modeled. In the case of a stenosis, the notions of shear stress-induced platelet activation in the acceleration zone and platelet deposition in the expansion zone downstream of the stenosis were studied. Results: The model provides the spatial and temporal evolution of thrombosis in the flow field. The computed density of platelets adherent to the surface was validated against experimental data. The results confirm the importance of considering both mechanical and chemical activation of platelets. Discussion: The developed model represents a potentially useful tool for the optimization of the design of the cardiovascular device flow path.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of glucose concentration in the culture medium on metabolism and viability of the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) co-cultured with the human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC) on polysulfone semipermeable flat membranes. Methods: Cells were isolated from umbilical veins and arteries obtained by Caesarean section. Membranes with a surface area of 2 cm2 were covered with fibronectin to promote cells' attachment and then were placed in specially designed inserts. Cultures were carried out in 12-well plates filled with culture medium containing glucose in normal (5 mM) or high (20 mM) concentration. The HUVEC and HUASMC were seeded on separate membranes or on both sides of the same membrane with density of 4,600 cells/cm2. Cultures have been conducted in standard conditions (37oC, 5% CO2) for 7 days. Activity of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell viability were analyzed using the flow cytometry (with DCFDA test and Annexin V / 7AAD test, respectively). Microscopic visualization of cells was made after fixation in formalin using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: In the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC the ROS activity was lower by 17% in the normal than in high glucose concentration. In normal glucose concentration the ROS activity of the HUVEC co-cultured with HUASMC was lower by 8% than in HUVEC cultured separately, whereas in high glucose concentration it was higher by 19%. Viability of HUVEC cultured separately in normal glucose concentration was higher by 4% than in high glucose concentration. Microscopic visualization of cells did not reveal any morphological differences. Discussion: In terms of the ROS activity the obtained preliminary results indicate a beneficial effect of HUASMC on HUVEC co-cultured in normal glucose concentration. The opposite tendency was observed in high glucose concentration.
   Objectives: Continuous rhythm monitoring is useful for predicting, determining and treating a large class of diseases. An implantable heart monitor is useful for this purpose. it has small dimensions and records events over a timeframe measured in years. The objective of the study is to develop methods and algorithms for determining QRS-complexes and disorders in the work of the heart. Methods: Several sources were used to obtain the ECG: large collections of recorded physiologic signals PhysioBank and BioModule BioHarness 3. Records of database have annotations with tags of QRS-complexes and conclusions of doctors. BioModule BioHarness 3 record lead V4 or V5 dependent on position electrodes. Sampling frequency is 1000 Hz. The records were made on the basis of I.M.Sechenov University Clinical Hospital No.1, Russia. The monitor of physiological parameters and the device for daily monitoring of ECG was installed by the patient simultaneously. Recording was carried out for 24 hours simultaneously on both instruments. The device for daily monitoring of ECG is used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the developed methods. MATLAB was used to implement algorithms. Results: Testing the algorithm with PhisioNet database resulted in a mean sensitivity of 99.21% and a mean specificity of 99.49%. Testing the algorithm with Biomodule 3 resulted in a mean sensitivity of 99.02% and a mean specificity of 93.69%. 16 records were analyzed. The analyzer gave an incorrect result in 2 cases. Discussion: A careful study of records revealed that algorithm sets false tags in the absence of contact between the electrodes and the surface of the human body. The device for daily monitoring of ECG continues to operate normally at the same time. A careful study of the annotations PhysioNet showed that they contain errors. Some records have been shortened or excluded for this reason.
   Objectives: The aim of this paper is to improve the design of the current commercial cannula being used by clinicians in order to minimise the blood flow stasis and thus avoid thrombosis in ECMO drainage cannula Methods: A CFD simulation is used in order to determine the optimum desing for the drainage cannula. The improved cannula design was fabricated and validated in-vitro using particle image velocimetry. Results: 16 different cannula designs were simulated and results were analysed in terms of velocity and mass flow rate at side holes and different sections of the cannula. Different parameters including side holes diameter, number, spacing, distance to the cannula tip, and angle relative to flow direction were investigated. Simulation results were in agreement with PIV. Discussion: This study demonstrated that the improved drainage cannula can significantly reduce blood flow stasis, and potentially thrombosis, in patients receiving ECMO.
   Objectives: The aim of this work was to study the influence of the constructive and personal characteristics of the wireless energy transfer system on the temperature distribution in biological tissues. The basic parameters of the transcutaneous energy transfer system, such as transmitted power, efficiency and displacements, were taken into account. The patient's personal characteristics, such as the thickness of biological tissue layers, were also taken into account. To obtain data on the level of thermal damage, Henriques and Moritz study was used. Methods: The temperature data was obtained using the numerical solution of a bioheat equation by the finite element method. This article mathematically evaluates thermal injury based on Henriques and Moritz study, in which damage can be represented as the speed of a chemical process. Results: The temperature distributions in the tissues corresponding to the following types of displacements were obtained: axial, lateral, angular and also for the case where there are no displacements. Also the temperature distributions in tissues with different structures were obtained. Further, the temperature values at the maximum heating points were used to estimate thermal damage to the tissues. Discussion: It was established that when a wireless energy transfer system is operated without displacements, the severity of thermal injury does not exceed the threshold corresponding to a first-degree burn. It was also found that the patient's personal characteristics are influenced by the temperature distribution in the case when a change in the thickness of a layer of biological tissue occurs in the region of the nearest heat source.
   Objectives: The objective of this work is the development of a two-phase blood model fluid for the use in upscaled flow models. In large scaled models of different flow geometries, frequently used water-glycerol mixtures are not sufficient because in critical regions with small gaps, e.g. between the rotor and the wall in cardiac support systems, the two-phases of blood have a great influence on the flow. Therefore, it is necessary that the model fluid represents both phases of blood: the plasma and the cells. Methods: Transparent alginate beads were used as a model of red blood cells. A water-glycerol mixture was used as a model fluid for plasma. The alginate beads made up about 40 % of the volume to model the proper hematocrit. Furthermore, the beads have a slightly higher density than the surrounding medium and keep floating once in motion. This was achieved by embedding hollow glass particles in the spheres that have a density <1.0 kg/l, also enabling particle tracking and flow analysis using the Particle Image Velocimetry method. A camera tracks the flow path of the beads through the required geometry. Reynolds similarity was maintained. Results: Flow analysis has been performed in an upscaled model of blade and gap of a ventricular assist device. Compared to a water-glycerol mixture, the proposed blood model fluid enabled the visualization of the strong influence of the two phases on the flow. Because of their transparency, it was possible to visualize the flow field at several layers in the fluid by choosing the appropriate light sections. Discussion: The proposed blood model fluid showed promising results in an initial case. Moreover, the results of the experiment lead to a possible optimization of the geometry of future rotor blades in blood pumps in order to reduce hemolysis. Further channel geometries will be explored. In the long term, the model can be used for experiments on flow analysis and optimization in blood pumps or as a validation model for CFD-codes to calculate multiphase flows.
   Objectives: FTR, the death rate among patients with complications, is an emerging quality metric, that has received an increasing focus in the last years. Concerning the management and outcome in life-threatening complications due to ECMO-insertion there are only few reports available. We report the successful rescue therapy in two patients of our hospitals large ECMO-patient cohort with severe ARDS who experienced right ventricular (RV)-perforation after v-v-ECMO-cannula insertion by the Seldinger's wire. Methods: RV perforation was assumed by deteriorating hemodynamics and immediate echo-cardiography showing cardiac tamponade during ECMO-cannula insertion. In cases of two patients an immediate bedside sternotomy was performed and the diagnosis verified. The source of bleeding was controlled and the tamponade was cleared. Either patient was transferred to the OR after ROSC for a definitive hemostasis and subsequent optimally controlled cannula placement. Results: Both patients survived this life-threatening event without neurological complications or further bleeding as well as no infections of the wounds. In Patient 1 the ECMO-therapy was not instituted immediately but later. This patient was weaned from ECMO after one week, survived six months but finally died due to an underlying disease. In Patient 2 switching the v-v- to an a-v-ECMO in the acute setting lead to a sufficient circulation during CPR. This patient was completely weaned from ECMO after 2 weeks and was finally discharged to rehabilitation after two months. Discussion: Successful management of seriously complicated ECMO- insertion is possible. The provision of an immediate bedside operative therapy and every kind of circulatory support to achieve ROSC seem to be essential in this setting. By reason of this concept a No-FTR situation could be achieved, which depicts a positive marker for quality of care for ECMO patients.
   Objectives: Blood trauma is an unintended consequence of mechanical circulatory support. Evidence indicates that exposure to high shears may induce sublethal changes to blood cells and also overt cell destruction. To determine whether such changes in blood properties have a functional impact on microcirculatory function, we examined the effect of surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass on the rheological properties of blood and also direct assessments of cell flux in the microcirculation. Methods: Thirty individuals requiring elective coronary artery bypass graft (n = 15) or valve surgery (n = 15) volunteered to participate. Dependent variables were collected prior to use of cardiopulmonary bypass, after 60 min of being on pump, and in the post-surgical period. Blood analyses included measurements of blood and plasma viscosity, red cell deformability, red cell aggregability, mechanical sensitivity of red cells, and levels of haemolysis, among others. Microcirculatory function was assessed using incident dark field visualisation of the sublingual vessels. Results and Discussion: Initial findings of this project indicate that blood viscosity and red cell aggregability are significantly affected by 60 min of cardiopulmonary bypass; these measures do not restore following the early post-surgical period. Microcirculatory assessments reveal altered transit and velocities of red cells, potentially indicating a link between biophysical assessments of blood and microcirculatory function. Extended presentation of this ongoing study will be presented, and discussed in the context of the secondary complications that still plague circulatory support patients.
   Objectives: Granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA), in which granulocytes and monocytes are removed from the patient's whole blood, is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of the present study was to clarify the effects of the anticoagulation methods used on blood clot formation in the column during GMA. Methods: Extracorporeal circulation was established for 60 minutes in male Sprague Dawley rats. A small column filled with 0.7 g of cellulose diacetate beads was used. We administered heparin at a total dose of 0.5 U/g by 2 different administration methods: the bolus administration method (single bolus administration prior to extracorporeal circulation) and the half bolus and half continuous administration method. During extracorporeal circulation the arterial pressure, column inlet pressure, venous pressure, and activated clotting time (ACT) were measured. The hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of the eluate of the residual clots was measured after the extracorporeal circulation. Results: Extracorporeal circulation was performed stably for 60 minutes without events like in-circuit coagulation, in both groups. The ACT reached its peak value within 30 minutes in the bolus administration group, to decline gradually thereafter; on the other hand, in the half bolus and half continuous administration group, the ACT remained nearly constant during the extracorporeal circulation. The Hb concentration in the eluate was significantly lower in the bolus administration group than in the half bolus and half continuous administration group. Discussion: The results indicated that even for the same total dose of heparin, clot formation in the column was influenced by the method of administration. We concluded that bolus administration of heparin, which led to early peaking of the ACT value was more effective to reduce residual blood clotting in the column as compared to half bolus and half continuous administration.
   Objectives: Suction at the inlet of a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) is common and known to cause adverse events. It occurs when tissue is drawn towards the cannula, thus leading to a reduced or even ceased flow. Moreover, the sudden occlusion can cause flow situations inside the device to be dramatically different from typical operation. The objectives were to quantify the effect of suction on the rotor bearing of an LVAD in an advanced development status and to mitigate unfavorable effects on the ongoing therapy and pump performance. Methods: A custom-made suction module was integrated into an established, active mock circulation loop upstream of an LVAD. This module comprises a membrane that can occlude the inflow cannula depending on the pressure in its fluid chamber relative to an adjustable air pressure chamber. The LVAD is equipped with rotor position sensors for online position tracking. Suction was initiated by reducing venous return and thus pump inlet pressure or by actively increasing air pressure in the respective chamber. The tests were performed with active and inactive suction speed control algorithms. Results: Spontaneous suction by reducing venous return was unlikely for the LVAD under test independently of the stationary air pressure applied. By actively provoking suction, increased radial force on the rotor was observed with uncharacteristic movement of the rotor. The radial gap remained satisfactory for all operational points and patient scenarios investigated. Suction was accurately detected by the controller and the speed reduced accordingly, thus leading to a relieve of the suction event. Discussion: Ventricular suction is a critical event in two ways as it negatively affects the LVAD therapy and secondly provokes uncharacteristic forces that might be critical for device performance. Future research is needed to ensure that experimental models of suction represent the variety of supported ventricles accurately.
   Objectives: Human amniotic membrane (AM) is employed in a broad field of applications as a wound dressing, corneal treatment, and scaffolding material. However, mechanical properties of native membranes vary depending on the zone of the placenta where the AM is obtained. For this reason, mimicking the AM through tissue engineering is a way to obtain a membrane with standardized properties. One technique to mimic the morphology of the extracellular matrix of AM is electrospinning. With electrospinning, a nanometric arranged similarly to the AM extracellular matrix made of different polymeric blends could be obtained. In addition, the correct storage is a key point in order to guarantee the availability of such tissue-engineered constructs for clinical applications. Methods: The AM extract is first prepared from native material and then freeze-dried. Afterwards, the AM-based scaffolds are obtained using blend electrospinning of polyethylene oxide and freeze-dried AM. Structural and compositional properties are assessed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal Raman spectroscopy. The mechanical properties are evaluated by static mechanical testing before and after cryopreservation. The scaffold is then seeded with multipotent stromal cells. The biocompatibility of the tissue-engineered AM is analyzed using cytotoxicity assay. Results: The tissue-engineered membrane presents a nanostructured morphology similar to the extracellular matrix of AM. The compositional results can detect the presence of collagen, fibronectin and hyaluronic acid in the final material. Preliminary results present changes in the mechanical properties related to the cryopreservation. The fabrication technique for the tissue-engineered AM seemed not to alter the biocompatibility with stem cells. Discussion: The AM is ideal for treatment of different tissues, and in combination with polymeric materials by electrospinning, it could be a suitable candidate for a tissue-engineered membrane with standardized properties.
   Objectives: A mixed flow blood pump with an outer casing diameter of 9 mm is proposed as part of an intracorporeal membrane oxygenator. The usage of a blood pump deals with major challenges in the design of an intravenous device, specifically overcoming the pressure drop and enabling a controllable blood flow. This study presents the design, manufacturing, experimental and numerical investigation of the pump prototype. Methods: The pump prototype was manufactured using a Kudo3D Titan 1 (Kudo3D Inc. Dublin, USA) 3D printer, utilizing liquid photo polymeric resin coupled with a digital light processing (DLP) curing process. A static test loop consisting of the pump, ultrasonic flow sensor and pressure sensors was used to obtain the pump characteristics at different rotational speeds ranging from 23000 to 32000 rpm. A water glycerol mixture with a dynamic viscosity of 3.4 mPa.s was selected as working fluid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out using the open source CFD code OpenFOAM (R). Results: Over the investigated range from 30 to 500 mmHg, stable characteristic curves at different rotational speeds were measured. At 27700 rpm, a flow rate of 1.4 L/min against a pressure difference of 174 mmHg was observed. CFD simulations show a good agreement of the numerically predicted and measured pump characteristics, with an average deviation of about 8 %. Discussion: The applied manufacturing process was capable to produce thin structured, complex parts down to 300 mu m wall thickness, durable enough to be used in experimental investigations up to 32000 rpm. Experimental pump characteristics show adequate performance of the proposed mixed flow pump for the intended purpose. CFD simulations accurately match the experimental pressure difference.
   Objectives: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a technique to evaluate lungs before transplantation. As a tool for experimental research, this method allows organ modification and assessment. However, the costs are high. The aim of this study was to establish a low-cost EVLP model on the one hand and to investigate the feasibility of surgical graft downsizing during EVLP on the other hand. We compared a lobectomy, a stapled wedge and a sutured wedge resection during EVLP. Methods: Pigs of 60 kg weight were used for organ harvesting. After cardiac death lungs were retrieved, flushed with Perfadex and perfused with autologous blood for 4 hours of EVLP. The circuit was assembled from an ECMO system consisting of a Deltastream DP2 pump (Medos), an Affinity Fusion oxygenator (Medtronic) and a hardshell reservoir. After 90 minutes of perfusion a lobectomy was performed. At intervals of 30 minutes, a stapled wedge resection and a sutured wedge resection were performed. Air leak and the loss of blood were measured. The function of the lung was monitored including pulmonary artery pressure and blood gas analysis. Results: 20 porcine lungs were used to establish a stable model. Another 7 lungs underwent surgical interventions. The blood loss after lobectomy (3,14 +/- 4,14 ml/min) and after stapled wedge resection (5,29 +/- 8,1 ml/min) was lower than after sutured wedge resection (33 +/- 17,36 ml/min). There was no major difference in air leak after the surgical interventions (lobectomy: 0,06 +/- 0,16 l/min vs. stapler: 0,03 +/- 0,09 l/min vs. suture: 0,04 +/- 0,1 l/min). The oxygenation performance was satisfactory. The pulmonary artery pressure was in a physiological range. Bleeding into the parenchyma after suture was higher compared to the other interventions. Discussion: The low-cost custom-made EVLP model presented here is feasible and stable. Surgical interventions during EVLP are possible. Performing a lobectomy and a wedge resection is superior to a wedge resection with suture regarding to the blood loss.
   Objectives: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) possess an exceptional differentiation potential, as they are able to differentiate towards cells from all three germ layers. Owing to this capability, they are an attractive cell source for regenerative medicine applications and in vitro disease models. To date, coated substrates with Matrigel (R) and Geltrex (TM) have been providing promising platforms for hiPSC culture and differentiation. Besides many advantages, both substrates provide some drawbacks such as batch-to-batch variation and xenogeneic origin, which pose problems in potential clinical applications. To tackle these issues, a matrigel-mimetic synthetic biomaterial able to maintain hiPSCs in culture is required. Cell behavior is controlled by a complex set of biophysical (e.g. stiffness) as well as biological (e.g. growth factors) parameters. In this study, we want to develop a fully synthetic hiPSC-supporting hydrogel that allows investigating the influence of biophysical and biological parameters on hiPSCs. Methods: The substrates were prepared via crosslinking starPEG and heparin molecules with different molar ratios. Substrates were biofunctionalized with two methods based on NHS ester binding to amine groups of laminins in different ratios. hiPSCs were seeded on substrates and the medium was changed every day. Cells were stained after 72 hours for pluripotency markers (OCT4-SSEA4). Results: Functionalized substrates with storage modulus of 4kPa maintained hiPSCs culture. On the other hand, no adherent cells were observed on the substrates with a storage modulus of 1kPa and 10kPa. Discussion: StarPEG-heparin hydrogels functionalized with laminin mixtures clearly represented an appropriate matrigel-mimetic growth substrate for the hiPSC culture and maintenance of their pluripotency. 3D cultures have already been shown to be superior to 2D and it is an outlook of this work.
   Objectives: Radiological procedures utilizing intravascular iodinated contrast media are being widely applied for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and represent one of the main causes of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN).In this hospital-based study we tried to assess predictors for the development of CIN in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Methods: A total of 5604 patients undergoing coronary angiogram/PCI from 2007-2017 were enrolled in the study. Multivariate predictors of CIN were identified by logistic regression using stepwise selection with entry and exit criteria of p < 0.1. A two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was constructed around the point estimate of the odds (OR). A p value Results: CIN occurred in 6 (1 parts per thousand) patients. The mean age of patients suffering from CIN was higher than in the whole population (66.5 +/- 31.15 vs. 58.66 +/- 28.57, p=0.03). Characteristics of patients who developed CIN were: older age, diabetes, higher creatinine and lower EF. The incidence of CIN in patients with diabetes was higher and statistically significant (84% vs. 16%, p=0.01). Emergency cases were at higher risk of developing CIN than elective patients (85% vs.15%, p=0.001), respectively. Diabetes, CKD and EF < 50% were independent predictors of CIN (RR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.88 - 7.132, p=0.008; RR 3.1, 95% CI: 2.17 - 6.682, p=0.003; RR 1.6, 95% CI: 2.88 - 7.132, p=0.01, respectively). Discussion: The development of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients who underwent angiography and PCI was mainly related to older age, diabetes, lower GFR and heart failure, but not contrast material exposure.
   Objectives: To examine the efficacy of the short-time total liquid ventilation (TLV) with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline for severe and lethal respiratory failure (experiment 1 and 2, respectively) induced by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Methods: In experiment 1, fifteen rats were divided into three groups: LPS+TLV group (treatment group) received 5-min TLV 20 min after LPS (5 mg/kg) administration, LPS+MGV group received 5-min mechanical gas ventilation (MGV) after the LPS administration, and PBS+MGV group received 5-min MGV 20 min after administration of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) instead of LPS. Ventilation weaning was performed after respiratory management for three hours. At two days after each treatment, hemodynamics and blood gas parameters were measured and the rats were subsequently sacrificed. The excised lungs were used for histological analysis and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In experiment 2, ten rats were divided into two groups: LPS+TLV group and LPS+MGV group. Ten mg/kg LPS was used for inducing lethal acute lung injury and the survival rate was used for the primary outcome. Results: In experiment 1, significant differences were confirmed between LPS+TLV group and LPS+MGV group in the value of blood oxygen, weight loss ratio, and inflammatory cytokines levels in BAL-fluid (p < 0.05). On the other hand, there was a significant difference only in arterial oxygen pressure between LPS+TLV group and PBS+MGV group. Severe inflammation in LPS+MGV group was also confirmed in the histological analysis. In experiment 2, all rats in LPS+MGV group died within two days, whereas 80% of the rats in LPS+TLV group survived for one week. Moreover, the conditions of the survival rats showed normal in the pulmonary function and the alveolar structure after one week. Discussion: It is indicated that 5-min TLV with oxygen micro/nano bubble dispersed saline after LPS administration prevented severe respiratory failure and improved the survival rate dramatically without any disorders.
   Objectives: Natural biological tissues have electrical conductivities and it is required that artificial tissues also possessed such a property. We investigated the specific conductivity (s) of the bionanomaterial in the composition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). Methods: We investigated the specific conductivity (s) of the bionanomaterial in the composition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). The aqueous dispersion contained 25 wt.% BSA, 0.45 wt.% SWCNT. Dispersion on silicon substrates was applied by screen printing. After drying, the formed layers had approximate sizes: area - 5'20 mm2, thickness - 5 15mm. For all samples the dependence of s on temperature t was recorded when they were in a thermostat. The s(t) curves were taken with a numerous cycle n = 1 5 with increasing and decreasing temperatures in the region of t 20 45 degrees C. Results: The following data was obtained. With increasing n, the values of s and the hysteresis on s(t) decreased: at n = 1 - s 0.11 S/m, temperature resistance coefficient a -0.004 K-1, hysteresis on s(t), i.e. R/R0 0.90, where R0 is the initial resistance, R is the final resistance; at n = 5 - s 36 S/m, a -0.002 K-1, R/R0 0.95. Spectral studies in the optical range did not reveal any changes in the sample before and after a cyclic thermal action, which underlines the stability of BSA. Thus, in the layers of the BSA/SWCNT the s increases and the hysteresis on s(t) decreases with n = 1 5. Apparently, this behavior is associated with an increase in the number of contacts between nanotubes in the albumin matrix. Discussion: The studied layers of the composite bionanomaterial (BSA/SWCNT) has an acceptable value of specific conductivity (1,10 S/m) and mechanical properties (hardness 300 MPa) and is promising for biomedical applications.
   Objectives: Determine the outcomes and survival of patients who receive a temporary total artificial heart (TAH) as bridge to transplant or as bridge to decision by evaluating data from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) database in the U.S. Methods: Review of the INTERMACS database between 2006 and April 2017 revealed a total of 450 patients had been implanted. The data was reviewed to determine survival rates, adverse events, and competing outcomes. Risk factors for mortality were determined using hazard function analysis. Results: Data from 450 patients (87% men; mean age, 50 years) were available in the INTERMACS database. The 2 most common diagnoses were dilated cardiomyopathy (50%) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (20%). Risk factors for right heart failure were present in 82% of patients. Most patients were INTERMACS Profile 1 (43%) or 2 (37%) at implantation. There were 266 patients who eventually underwent transplantation, and 162 died. Overall 3-, 6-, and 12-month actuarial survival rates were 73%, 62%, and 53%, respectively. Risk factors for death included older age (p = 0.001), need for pre-implantation dialysis (p = 0.006), higher creatinine (p = 0.008) and lower albumin (p < 0.001) levels, and implantation at a low-volume center (<= 10 TAHs; p < 0.001). Competing-outcomes analysis showed 71% of patients in high-volume centers were alive on the device or had undergone transplantation at 12 months after TAH implantation vs 57% in low-volume centers (p = 0.003). Discussion: Patients receiving TAHs have rapidly declining cardiac function and require prompt intervention. Experienced centers have better outcomes, likely related to patient selection, timing of implantation, patient care, and device management. Organized transfer of knowledge to low-volume centers could improve outcomes
   Objectives: To analyze the hemodynamic effect of ventricular assist devices using a multi-scale mathematical model of the human extracellular fluid system. Methods: A Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) model has been incorporated into the Digital Avatar, a multi-scale, closed-loop mathematical model of the human fluid system is composed of a network of major arteries, major veins, and lumped parameter models for the heart, pulmonary circulation, arterioles, capillaries, venules, cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitial fluid. The mathematical model relies on one-dimensional PDEs for blood vessels and on ODEs for lumped parameter models. Results: Based on the model, we have quantified the hemodynamics of the systemic circulation with and without the medical device in healthy and unhealthy scenarios. Results will be shown at the conference. Discussion: Traditionally, bench testing, animal studies and clinical trials are used as the main source of evidence for getting medical devices on the market in the US. The associated costs and time are enormous and represent a burden for MedTech companies. In addition, the FDA wants to minimize animal and human study testing. In recent years, Computational Modelling and Simulation (CM&S) has made huge steps forward. CM&S are a valuable regulatory tool for its significant cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating performance under scenarios that may not be possible with human use and quantifying the safety and efficacy of medical devices. However, the existing CM&S tools are highly specialized for each field and do not provide a platform that integrates all human body mechanisms. Computational Life's vision is to replicate all body mechanisms into a single, integrated software called Digital Avatar platform. The Digital Avatar platform will enable MedTech companies to perform feasibility testing and quantify the safety and the efficacy of (ideally) any type of medical device. Here we will show an application with the VAD system.
   Objectives: Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro cultivation systems have gained increased attention, since using these systems allows the precise study of mammalian cell physiology, intercellular interaction, as well as cell-matrix interactions. Another important cell culture parameter, often neglected in traditional cultivation, is the concentration of dissolved oxygen. Generally, cell culture is performed under ambient oxygen saturation (21%), while the oxygen amount available in vivo in human tissue is much lower (1% to 15%). The stiffness of in vivo tissues and in vitro constructs also plays a crucial role in cell fate and physiology. Methods: Semi-synthetic hydrogels with tunable properties allow creating a wide range of in vitro material stiffness. The development of hydrogel-based 3D cell culture gradient systems enables to obtain complex, but precisely defined in vitro microenvironments, which in turn allow a systematic investigation of the influence of microenvironmental conditions. Oxygen gradients in 3D and 2D cell culture can be created with the help of incubation chambers. Results: Encapsulation of mesenchymal stem cells containing fluorescent hypoxia sensors reveals specific conditions where the hypoxic response is activated and determines the influence of hydrogel stiffness on the hypoxic response. In the presented study, exact correlations between in situ O2 concentrations in 3D cell cultures (hydrogels and microtissues) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) activation are disclosed for the first time. Discussion: Creating stable in vitro oxygen gradients in 3D hydrogel-based cultures with stiffness variety helps to better understand and predict cell behavior (survival, cytokine expression, spontaneous differentiation of stem cells or migration capacity) in physiological and pathological in vivo conditions, as well as to find optimal conditions to simulate the in vivo cell niche.
   Objectives: Most breast and prostate cancers metastasize to the bone. To establish macrometastases, the disseminated tumor cells (DTC) need to have stem cell-like properties such as self-renewal and differentiation into other tumor cells. They compete with hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) for their specific microenvironment or 'niches'. Apart from biochemical factors in niches, biophysical cues also influence such interactions. The aim of this project is to investigate the intercellular crosstalk that occurs among these cells and the signalling pathways in a 3D porous hydrogel that was previously established in our group. Methods: The hydrogel mimics in structure the trabecular region of the bone marrow. Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions will be investigated using fluorescence imaging techniques. The pathways will be analyzed with the help of Western blots and specific inhibitors. Cytokine array and ELISA will be used for assessing auto- and paracrine communication via soluble factors. The biophysical parameters such as the 3D architecture and mechanical properties will also be tuned and their effect studied. Results: The coculture of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with bone marrow-derived MSCs and the leukemic cell line KG-1a reveal formation of spheroid-like structures in the gels. Experiments are being performed to study the cell-cell interactions within these structures. Parallel experiments are being carried out regarding the effect of the 3D architecture, which will be introduced by varying the porosity of the gel. Discussion: The results of these studies will help us to develop in vitro models of different tumor cell niches that will allow us in gaining a fundamental insight into the early events of bone metastasis. Tuning these parameters in the 3D bone marrow analog, we can have an understanding about how the biophysical cues affect the cellular activities.
   Objectives: Bioartificial liver devices aim to replace the detoxification and metabolic functions of the liver in people with liver failure. Shear stress and local velocities created by flow inside porous scaffolds need to be optimised to improve cell viability and avoid inflammation, however there are no relevant studies on the topic to date. Here, fluid dynamics inside porous cryogels were characterised using a purpose-built micro-PIV system. The aims were to develop a micro-PIV setup to record the flow inside cryogel structure and to characterise the nature of flow inside the cryogel channels by video post-processing in order to determine inlet design. Methods: HEMA- based cryogels were synthesised by cryogelation technique and the microstructure was analysed by SEM, confocal microscope and mu CT. Open porosity, overall porosity and permeability were extrapolated from mu CT. A mu PIV set up was developed to visualise flow inside cryogels which was composed of a digital camera with a long-distance microscope objective, a pulsating LED light source, a pump and an optical chamber to host the cryogel. Glass beads of 10 mu m size were used as tracers to mimic red blood cells. Videos were analysed with PIVlab in Matlab which allowed the interpolation of local velocities. Results: Cryogels possessed an open porosity, with pore size up to 100 mu m, as well as an interconnected network of pores, making it suitable for a perfused system. Fluid dynamics were optimized using a mu PIV setup which allows for the visualisation of flow inside the cryogel channels. Discussion: Videos showed that internal flow did not reorganize itself through the channels and was found to be laminar with Re < 1 with low vorticity. This suggests that molecules and toxins of the blood in the centre of a channel would not interact with hepatocytes seeded on the cryogel pore walls. Hence, flow reorganization could be promoted through a layered bioreactor. A layered cryogel structure was introduced to improve flow characteristics and improve toxin/hepatocyte interaction.
   Objectives: Generation of a large-scale stem cell derived bioartificial cardiac tissue (BCT) as a potential therapeutic option to replace damaged myocardium after myocardial infarction. Methods: Large-scale BCT was generated from cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) mixed with human fibroblasts and a hydrogel solution in a newly designed tissue chamber with a diameter of 43 mm. The BCT development was microscopically recorded and evaluated. Maturation of CMs within the tissue was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining for cardiac markers (alpha-SA, cTnT) as well as cell junction proteins (Con. 43, N-Cad). The integration of the tissue chamber in the novel custom-made bioreactor allowed investigating the initial parameters for electromechanical stimulation (such as pressure, stress amplitude, frequency) necessary for proper tissue maturation in a more physiological manner. To investigate the calcium handling through the tissue a new transgenic hiPSC line containing a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) has been developed. Results: Microscopically evaluation at different time points reveals a progressive reduction of nearly 27% of the initial volume after 15 days, ccorresponding with an increased intercellular connectivity. After 48h, the tissue exhibited spontaneous contractions and coordinated and rhythmic contraction within the whole tissue after 6 days. As preliminary analysis, the beating of the tissue was video-optically recorded showing an estimated beating rate of 102 beats per minute. Immunofluorescence staining performed at day 15 showed highly organised cross-striations of sarcomere proteins. Initial integration of the tissue chamber in the bioreactor and implementation of the new GCaMP6f reporter cell line is still on-going. Discussion: The initial results confirmed that is possible to generate a large-scale BCT. However, the properties of the tissue have to be further investigated.
   Objectives: The Fontan procedure is performed for univentricular correction of the heart in pediatric patients with tricuspid atresia. In the Fontan circulation, the veins connect directly to the pulmonary artery. However, as a result of the procedure the load on the single functional ventricle of the heart and veins increases. Eventually, patients need a heart transplantation. A possible solution to the circulation deficiencies of the Fontan patients could be the ventricular assist device (VAD). The VAD is implanted between veins and the pulmonary artery. The aim of this study is to develop a model of the Fontan circulation with VAD support. Methods: We use mathematical models to reduce the time and resources spent on in vivo research. Nonlinear mathematical models represent sections of the cardiovascular system (CVS) in the form of blocks. Pressure variations in the CVS sections are described by a system of differential equations. Results: Appling VAD to the Fontan patients exhibits the potential to increase the venous return of blood. According to the Frank-Starling law, the stroke volume increases with increasing venous return. VAD creates a necessary pressure differential between the venous and pulmonary sections of CVS. Discussion: The interaction model of the Fontan circulation with VAD support demonstrates the normalization of the pressure and volume distribution in the CVS. This indicates that the method studied in this work may be a way to optimize the health condition of patients after Fontan procedure.
   Objectives: Autologous pericardium is one of the most ideal materials for cardiovascular reconstruction including pulmonary arteries and valvular cusps especially in pediatric patients. To improve the surgical handling, chemical pretreatments such as dehydration by ethanol (ET) or crosslinking by glutaraldehyde (GA) have been commonly attempted. In this study, we compared the effects of such chemical treatments with short period (10 min) on the mechanical properties of the porcine pericardium. Methods: Porcine pericardium (n=3) was separated into 3 groups, raw group with no treatments (RAW), that under dehydration with 70% ET for10 min (ET) and crosslinking with 0.6% GA for 10 min (GA). We measured 5 parameters of mechanical properties: the burst pressure, suture retention strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS), ultimate strain (%) and stimulus modulus. Results: Minimal burst pressure of RAW group, ET group and GA group were 12160 mmHg, 10640 mmHg, and 8360 mmHg, respectively, all of which were high enough for cardiovascular substitutes. There were no significant differences in suture retention strength (RAW: 3.242 +/- 0.261 N, ET: 3.298 +/- 0.214 N, GA: 2.985 +/- 0.165 N, p=0.529), UTS (RAW: 18.238 +/- 1.987 MPa, ET: 19.104 +/- 2.234 MPa, GA: 16.059 +/- 1.233 MPa, p=0.486) or Young's modulus (RAW: 4.964 +/- 0.551 MPa, ET: 4.544 +/- 0.719 MPa, GA: 3.921 +/- 0.288 MPa, p=0.408). Only the ultimate strain of GA group was significantly higher between the 3 groups (RAW: 35.64 +/- 2.82 %, ET: 37.99 +/- 2.38 %, GA: 46.39 +/- 3.96 %, p=0.046). Discussion: Short period of chemical treatment using ET and GA might make it possible to improve the surgical handling without deteriorating the mechanical properties of pericardium.
   Engineering modelling and simulation have been being used in different industries for better product and process development for already many decades. Together with the developments in medical imaging, this engineering approach can now be applied to understand how different human organs function and eventually develop devices to replace them or support their correct functioning. A digital environment for development of artificial organs and medical devices is possible with correct application of engineering modelling and simulation. These concepts enable researchers and engineers to perform design iterations rapidly and with ease. This is why the application of engineering modelling and simulation is considered as one of the very important bio-technological advancements in the recent years and is projected to be so in the close future. In this respect; cardiology is one of the areas where this potential is being converted to valuable outputs. Virtual modelling and analysis of a representative beating human heart, patient specific heart modelling or digital prototypes of heart devices are main research interests of an interdisciplinary community of cardiologists, surgeons, engineers, and physicians. In the scope of cardiovascular simulations; patient specific (or normalized among a group of patients) medical imaging based CFD simulations and coupled multiphysics FSI simulations are the main approaches for generating the simulation frameworks moving forward in the road to ultimate digital twins of the human heart. This presentation is intended to give insights about various processes that lead to higher fidelity digital representations in the scope of cardiovascular simulations, including below:
   - CFD model generation based on CT scans - Non-invasive digital angiography & FFR CT (Fractional Flow Reserve) - Post-TAVI coronary flow - Blood flow in SIMULIA LHHM (Living Heart Human Model) with mechanical valves - Transcatheter tissue engineered aortic valve FSI simulation - Evolut R stent deployment in LHHM - Mitral Valve and Mitral Clip FSI simulation The presentation intends to give a brief introduction on the simulation concepts/approaches which can be applied to cardiovascular problems. While it intends to encourage the community to take the advantage of these concepts in cardiovascular research, it highlights the importance of correct modelling and accurate numerical simulations.
   Objectives: The Berlin Heart EXCOR is the most commonly used ventricular assist device in children. Pump thrombosis is a major complication of the system and is most likely to occur in smaller pumps used for children under the age of 2. Pump exchange is seen as the therapeutic gold standard, but is associated with high mortality if in- or outflow cannulas are affected and therefor have to be changed surgically. Methods: Herein we report our experience in the use of tissue-type plasminogen activator (Alteplase, Actilyse (R)) for the therapy of an acute pump thrombosis subtotally occluding the inflow cannula of a 7 month old girl supported by a Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD. The infant was supported by LVAD therapy used for acute left ventricular failure due to fulminant myocarditis, and the system was implanted 20 days prior to when the thrombotic event was reported. A treatment protocol of 1.2mg/kg - initial bolus application of 0.12mg/kg/2mins - of Alteplase infusion given continuously for 120mins was used, and the assist device was connected to a Maquet Quadrox-I neonatal and pediatric oxygenator to obviate thrombembolic complications. Results: The infant supported by Berlin Heart EXCOR LVAD was haemodynamically stable prior to the thrombotic event, and anticoagulation was performed with a continuous heparin infusion. Within a couple of hours, she became tachycardic and developed signs of low cardiac output, and a subtotal occlusion of the inflow cannula of the Berlin Heart System was diagnosed. As surgery was felt to be highly problematic, we decided to infuse Alteplase and achieved short-term success with resolution of the pump thrombosis within 2 hours. There was no adverse event. Discussion: Tissue-type plasminogen activator thrombolysis might be an effective treatment for Berlin Heart EXCOR thrombosis in haemodynamically compromised children. Additionally, the use of a Maquet Quadrox-I oxygenator might minimize the risk of major complications (i.e. thromboembolism) that have been reported in the literature.
   Drug discovery and development to date has relied on animal models, which are useful, but fail to resemble human physiology. The discovery of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of drug screening using human patient- and disease-specific organ/tissue-models. One promising approach to generate these models is by combining the hiPSC technology with microfluidic devices tailored to create microphysiological environments. Such organ-on-a-chip platforms (OoCs) or microphysiological systems combine human genetic background, in vivo-like tissue structure, physiological functionality, and "vasculature-like" perfusion. Using microfabrication techniques, we have developed a variety of OoCs that incorporate complex human 3D tissues, such as retinal, choroidal, cardiac, pancreatic, and adipose tissue. By generating microphysiological environments the platform is capable of keeping the tissues viable and functional over multiple weeks. The OoCs generally consist of three functional components: organ-specific tissue chambers mimicking in vivo structure and microenvironment of the respective tissues; "vasculature-like" media channels enabling a precise and computationally predictable delivery of soluble compounds (nutrients, drugs, hormones); "endothelial-like" barriers protecting the tissues from shear forces while allowing diffusive transport. The small scale and accessibility for in situ analysis makes our OoCs amenable for both massive parallelization and integration into a high-content-screening approach. To facilitate and enable the adoption of OoCs in industrial and non-specialized laboratories, we have developed technologies for automated 3D tissue generation and for the flexible plug&play connection of individual modules to multi-organ-chips. These technologies paired with the versatility of our OoCs pave the way for applications in drug development, personalized medicine, toxicity screening, and mechanistic research.
   Objectives: The HeartMate 3 (HM3; Abbott, USA) is a new compact LVAD which is associated with several new technical features (e.g. fully magnetically levitated pump, artificial pulse, large pump gaps, modular driveline, etc.). These benefits are supposed to lead to superior outcomes and reduced adverse events as compared to its predecessor HeartMate II (HMII; Abbott, USA) and other comparable assist devices. With this study, we investigated the effect of HM3 implantation on the occurrence of gastrointestinal (GI) bleedings compared to other LVADs. Methods: We retrospectively studied a patient cohort of 595 patients who were supported with left ventricular assist devices. 170 Patients were supported by HMII, 81 Patients were supported by HM3 and 344 Patients were supported by HVAD (HeartWare, Medtronic, USA). Data was determined through retrospective examination of medical records. Exclusion criteria were biventricular assist devices and other types of assist devices as well as LVAD exchange and re-operative procedures. Results: Out of 595 patients 146 patients (24.4%) presented with gastrointestinal bleeding after LVAD implantation. In the multivariate analysis GI bleeding was significantly dependent on age but not on the BMI or gender of the patient. Statistically we were able to show that the occurrence of GI bleedings is significantly connected to general bleedings but not to cerebral hemorrhages. The subgroup analysis revealed that the occurrence of GI bleedings was higher in the HVAD (26%) and HMII (26%) groups compared to the HM3 patients (14%). However, statistical significance could not be achieved. Discussion: The novel HeartMate 3 shows a promising adverse event profile with a reduced rate of gastrointestinal bleedings compared to its competitors. However statistical significance could not be achieved in this study. Thus, larger multi-center cohort analyses are needed.
   Objectives: In medical practice, it is necessary to control the movements of various parts of the body: limbs, joints, chest, tumors, etc. For such purposes, the most suitable are the composite bionanomaterials in the composition of carbon nanotubes. We investigated the strain sensor (tensoresistor) based on the layers of the bionanomaterial contained biological material (bovine serum albumin, BSA - matrix) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT - filler). Methods: The aqueous dispersion of 25 wt.% BSA/0.3 wt.% MWCNT was applied by screen printing on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates. After drying layers by laser irradiation ( 970 nm) various parameters of layers were controlled, i.e. resistance R, bending angle q, number of cycles n, measurement time, etc. One measurement cycle corresponded to a change within the range q >>+/- 150 degrees. Results: The slopes of Sq = (1/R0)dR/dq of the R(q) curves were considered to be strain-sensitivities, where R0 is the resistance of the sensor with q=0. It was found that with increasing the number n, R and Sq increase and the hysteresis on R(q) decreases. For the tensoresistor obtained: specific resistances 0.1 divided by 1 Wxm, Sq1.0 divided by 1.5%/grad. These results are high. Discussion: The physical picture of the change in the R(q) is as follows. When q>0, compression occurs, the amount of contacts between the nanotubes increases and the resistance drops relative to the state q=0. When q<0, the nanotubes move away from each other, the amount of contacts between the nanotubes decreases and the resistance increases relative to the state q=0. The examined layers of the bionanomaterial BSA/MWCNT as a strain sensor is of a particular interest for medical practice. In particular, for monitoring: movements (arms, blinking) and detection of signs of pathology (respiratory diseases, angina, et. al.).
   The new European Medical Device Regulation (MDR) is applicable on 26th May 2020. Then the current Medical Device Directive(MDD) and its national transpositions like the current German Medical Device Act (Medizinproduktegesetz) will be replaced by the new rules. Further transitions periods for existing certificates will not help for devices of the lowest risk class and will not free parties from taking into consideration the new rules for handling of device problems or registration. The new certification of existing devices in time will be challenging, because the accreditation and notification of notified bodies in accordance with the new requirements, which are needed for certification of higher risk class medical devices, is ongoing very slowly. The new European database is still not gone live, but the device and economic operator registration is dependent on the functioning of that database. A strong focus of the new regulation is on clinical evaluation of medical devices, which will leave manufacturers and developers probably with open questions. For example, what extend of clinical data is sufficient for keeping an existing device on the market? The presentation will highlight several obvious or less obvious changes due to the new regulation. It will provide guidance where to find additional answers for specific questions. And it will give an outlook on upcoming additional legislation and guidance.
   Objectives: Exercise capacity in patients with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is 50% compared to healthy subjects. Some patients show a better performance than others. Aim of this work is to investigate the factors responsible of this inter-subject variability. Methods: A cardiorespiratory simulator (CRS) was developed and combined with a model of the HVAD running at 2700 rpm to reproduce an "average" LVAD patients hemodynamic at rest and at exercise. The CRS was validated using the average hemodynamic data of >200 LVAD patients from the literature. Starting from this "average" LVAD profile, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating a left/right ventricular contractility (Elmax/Ermax) and heat rate (HR) 20% higher than value usually observed at exercise. Results: The simulated "average" LVAD profile at rest is in full support with a total cardiac output (CO) of 4.8 l/min and a wedge pressure (Pw) of 13 mmHg. At exercise Pw increases to 26 mmHg and CO increases to 6.8 l/min, of which 5.3 l/min pumped by the LVAD (QLVAD) and 1.5 l/min by the ventricle (QLV). An increased Elmax at exercise assures lower Pw (22 mmHg) and higher CO (7.4 l/min) due to a better contribution of the ventricle (QVAD=4.7 l/min, QLV=2.7 l/min). An improved HR also helps to sustain a better CO (7.1 l/min) as a combined effect of both pumps (QVAD= 5.4 l/min, QLV=1.7 l/min). A better Emaxr induces a smaller improvement in CO (7.0 l/min) due to the increased LVAD support (QVAD=5.5 l/min, QLV=1.5 l/min), however Pw reaches 31 mmHg. Discussion: A better left ventricular inotropic response is mostly effective in accommodating a higher CO at exercise. A better right ventricular function has mild effects on CO and can increase Pw if not sustained by a good ejection on the left side. These results should be taken into account for the design of a physiological LVAD speed controller, tailored on specific patient's needs.
   The electro-hydraulically actuated Carmat total artificial heart (C-TAH) is designed for biventricular replacement in patients suffering from end-stage heart failure, either as bridge to transplant or destination therapy. It generates pulsatile flow which is automatically adapted to the patient's physiological needs. The device contains bio-prosthetic blood contacting materials, allowing for low dose anti-coagulation. A multi-centre European study is currently underway to assess the safety and performance of the C-TAH, with 6-months survival as primary objective. Preliminary results will be presented from a cohort of 10 patients included in the study.
   Objectives: The mechano-biological behavior of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in 2D and 3D cultures is determined by formation of actin filaments which occur as branched stress fibers. For clinical-scale expansion of functional MSCs, the use of xeno-based serum products is prohibited, but human platelet lysate (HPL) can potentially replace fetal bovine serum. Here we investigate actin filament formation and mitochondrial morphology in the 2D and 3D MSC culture supplemented with HPL and analyzed immunomodulatory molecules GARP, Foxp3 and IDO following pro-inflammatory stimulation. Methods: Human platelet lysate composition was determined with a proteome profiler assay. Amnion derived MSCs were cultured in HPL supplemented media and MSC morphology was analyzed by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Mechano-biological properties of cultured MSCs were performed by atomic force microscopy. Results: The occurrence of actin filaments in 2D MSCs cultivated in HPL supplemented media was decreased as compared to conventional growth media, where the number of ventral stress fibers, anchored at each end by focal adhesions, was affected and influenced membrane elasticity. Dorsal stress fibers or transverse arcs were not affected. Mitochondrial network dynamics in HPL cultivated MSCs showed a perinuclear accumulation. 3D cultivation of MSCs was less sensitive to media supplementation. Functional activity of GARP was found non-stimulated MSCs while expression of Foxp3 and IDO relied on pro-inflammatory stimuli. Discussion: In conclusion we can say that mechano-biological capabilities of MSCs cultivated in 2D and 3D rely on stress fibers, mitochondrial distribution and certain bioactive molecules such as GARP, Foxp3 and IDO. HPL supplementation leads to downregulation of f-actin filament formation as well as conserved membrane elasticity.
   Objectives: Modern research in cryobiology requires a deeper understanding of the influence of different factors on the cryopreservation of cells, tissues, and organs. One of these factors is ice crystallization which has a tremendous impact on the surveillance and quality of live objects during freezing, long term storage, and thawing. Analysis of this process requires software which should be able to obtain quantitative parameters of crystals in a human-like manner with acceptable processing speed. The purpose of this work is to consider the possibility of using the multiscale image representation for the quantitative analysis of ice crystals. Methods: In our research, we used microscopic images of ice crystals during crystals formation and thawing. In previous studies for the segmentation of ice crystals on the image, we used different approaches such as active contour. At the same time, it should be noticed that the speed of active contour expansion is low and thus time-consuming to process large time sequence. Thus, we suggest the application of a Gaussian Pyramid. This multiscale representation allows analysis at a low scale and improves at a high scale. Results: We have analyzed multiple images using the proposed approach. The results in the first approximation show a 2-fold increase in speed when using our implementation of active contours. At the same time, the segmented areas of crystals correspond to the approach without the use of multi-scale image representation. Discussion: The results of this work show that multiscale image representation can be applied to improve the speed and applicability of modern software for automated image analysis. The next steps will include applicability evaluation of multiscale representation for different cases as well as the development of software realizing vector processor architecture.
   Objectives: One of the objectives of hemodialysis (HD) is preserving optimal acid-base homeostasis. Bicarbonate is an obligatory component of dialysis fluids in order to titrate the acidic products of protein metabolism that accumulate between treatments. Even though bicarbonate can easily transfer across HD membranes, its plasma concentration does not equilibrate with that in dialysis fluid by the end of the treatment, for reasons unclear. We used a mathematical model to test whether an intradialytic increase in total non-bicarbonate buffer concentration in plasma (tNBBp) could explain this lack of equilibrium. Methods: We modified the model of CO2 and bicarbonate whole body transport proposed in 1995 by Rees and Andreassen, adding bicarbonate transfer from dialysis fluid to plasma via a dialyzer connected to an arteriovenous fistula. The model described the transport of O2, CO2, and base excess between different compartments: arterial and venous circulations, interstitial fluid and lung capillaries. In each compartment, equations describing the biochemistry of blood were solved to estimate the components of bicarbonate and non-bicarbonate buffer systems. Results: The model qualitatively described the typical intradialytic pattern of bicarbonate concentration, pH, base excess, CO2 and O2 partial pressures observed in patients under routine thrice weekly HD. Model predictions were compared assuming a constant or increasing tNBBp during HD. When tNBBp was allowed to increase, the intradialytic increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration was blunted and the model predictions better fit published time-dependent intradialytic plasma bicarbonate concentrations. Discussion: It was suggested in literature that HD treatment may stimulate an increased concentration of non-bicarbonate buffers and release of hydrogen ions from these organic acids. Our preliminary modeling results are consistent with this hypothesis and show that the model is capable of predicting the effect of the HD treatment on the buffer systems of the body.
   Objectives: To develop an implant for the bone-tendon transition, it is our approach to optimize polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds by coating for a functionalization with drug release systems. The procedure during the functionalization should enable a release of growth factors in a spatially and temporally graded way. Methods: The PCL fiber mats were prepared by electrospinning. Polydopamine (pDA)-based coatings were used to modify the surface of the fibers. To get thin polymeric, hydrophilic and biocompatible coatings we applied the pure pDA system and a co-deposition with amines (ethylenediamine (ED), hexamethylenediamine (HMD) and polyethyleneimine (PEI)). To functionalize our system with growth factors we used chitosan-based nanoparticles which can be loaded with the therapeutic proteins BMP-2 and TGF-beta. By a defined dipping procedure we generate fiber mats with a graded functionalization. Results: The measurement of the contact angle and the surface zeta potential showed a change from a hydrophobic PCL surface to a highly hydrophilic and amphoteric character for the coated systems. The charged surface enables the further functionalization with loaded nanoparticles. The release of BMP2 and TGF-beta from the functionalized scaffolds was established. With a dipping procedure we are able to functionalize our scaffolds in a graded way. Confocal laser scanning microscopy with fluorescence-labeled NP showed that we could generate up to three differently functionalized regions. Discussion: The results show the methodology is suited to prepare implants, which can release growth factors in a spatially and temporally controlled way. These graded implants can be used for in-situ tissue engineering.
   Objectives: Solute movement from blood to dialysis solution is largely determined by transmembrane pressure (TMP). Accordingly, it was imperative to develop a TMP control system that allows for the maintanence of constant pressure. TMP in dialyzer is one of the tasks in wearable artificial kidney development. In most of the known devices, transmembrane pressure is regulated only by adjusting the flow-pressure characteristics of the pump or mechanical uncontrolled clamping line. Methods: A system was proposed which consists of a pinch valve, a DC motor and a control circuit. This device allows you to automatically adjust the pressure. At first, the device reads data from the differential sensor, which measures the TMP. After that, the position of the moving part of the pinch valve changes and the degree of clamping of the line changes, which in turn affects the value of TMP. The case of the device was made using a 3D printer. A test bench was created in order to determine the effectiveness of maintaining a constant TMP. It consists of five parts: two circuits with two peristaltic pumps, a dialyzer, a differential pressure sensor and a power source. The pressure from the primary circuit was varied by manually clamping the line and the degree of pressure differential compensation by the pinch valve was determined. Results: The experiment showed that the TMP changes are fully compensated by the pinch valve. Accuracy of the developed device depends largely on accuracy of pressure measurement sensor. There was no change in the flow rate of the fluid, and this is important, because the rate of dialysate regeneration depends on the flow rate of the fluid. Discussion: The experiment showed that this device can be used to control TMP. Accuracy of the system allows you to use it in the wearable artificial kidney.
   Objectives: This paper describes the testing methods used in the development of software for an implantable heart monitor. It is a complex medical system. To identify errors made while writing software, as well as to detect deviations in the operation of the device in a timely manner, it is necessary to constantly carry out testing of all elements of the system. Methods: Testing methods used in the development of an implantable heart monitor: - debugging using JTAG, - self-test system, - testing via COM port, - recording test information in the device's internal memory (data logging), - interprocessor testing. Consider some of them in more detail. Debugging and testing using JTAG: Due to the fact that the development was carried out in Code Composer environment, this allowed the use of a special script language GEL (General Extension Language). This is an expression language used by the CCS debugger. Launch GEL files are used to automate software development. GEL is an interpreted language, and its syntax is the same as C. Thereby it is possible to carry out tests, and change them, or add new ones in the process of the main software. Logging: One of the testing methods is to track changes in the state of the system over time. One way is to write data to the device's internal memory. But in such a way that you can track at what point in time the change occurred. For this you can use time stamps. If the data is recorded strictly with a certain frequency, you can do without time stamps. Results: The presented test methods differ in that some of them can be used only in the early stages of development and some even when the device is at the end user. Discussion: Cardiovascular diseases are very dangerous and difficult to diagnose. Early diagnosis and prediction of these diseases can lead to an improvement in the quality of life of patients.
   Objectives: To clarify the reasons, beneficial effects and duration of AVF patency after radiological interventions in AVF stenosis. Methods: In 174 patients, 522 radiological investigations and endovascular treatments such as percutaneous trans luminal angioplasty (PTA) were analyzed, retrospectively. All investigations were performed due to clinical suspicion of impaired AVF function. Results: Arterial stenosis was significantly more frequent among patients with diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001) and interstitial nephritis (p < 0.001). According to the venous stenosis, the diagnosis did not affect the frequency (p=0.22), neither the degree of the stenosis (p=0.39). The degree of stenosis prior to PTA correlated significantly with the degree of remaining stenosis after intervention (p<0.001). Of the 174 patients, 123 (71%) performed a total of 318 PTA investigations. Repeated PTA was performed significantly more often in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The median times to first PTA and to the subsequent PTAs were 9.5 months and 5 months, respectively. Discussion: Patients with diabetic nephropathy are at a greater risk of getting recurrent stenosis; this motivates a closer follow up for these patients. Clinically significant stenosis should be dilated as meticulously and as soon as possible. Occlusions of the AVF in most instances can be successfully thrombolyzed or dilated upon early diagnosis.
   Objectives: Designing new ventricular assist devices to coupe two major challenges in the field: less invasive intervention and reducing side effects was our objective. Methods: Computer-aided design and computational fluid dynamics were performed with Solidworks 2017 to design and test several new bearingless centrifugal ventricular assist devices. Fused deposition modeling was used to build the models and subcutaneous implantation was simulated and transcutaneous power transfer was tested. Results: Two bearingless, fully implantable ventricular assisted devices were developed. The first is a radial flux motor fully magnetically levitated ventricular assist device. The second is an axial flux hydro-magnetically suspended rotor ventricular assist device. Both devices contain an internal rechargeable battery, power transfer coil, electronic circuit and have a cylindrical shape with 15-20 mm height and 100 mm diameter. The flow is 3 l/min at 135 mmHg is achieved and efficiency of power transfer of 80% with a 5 mm gap. The devices are implantable in a pectoral subcutaneous pocket with the inflow connected to left atrium and the outflow to subclavian artery in a fashion pioneered in this field by CircuLite Synergy. Discussion: Both devices came with innovations in motor and pump design that set the foundation to build the entire system in a single body low height cylindrical shape, optimal for subcutaneous implantation and by this with good transcutaneous power transfer efficiency.
   Objectives: For most in vitro cultivations of mammalian cells, culture medium is supplemented with serum, which contains important proteins and factors for the cell growth. Previous experiments showed already a positive effect of human platelet lysate (hPL) as a medium supplement for the two-dimensional (2D) cultivation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Since 3D culture systems gain big interest for in vitro applications and regenerative medicine, the influence of hPL on 3D cell culture models must also be investigated. Semi synthetic protein not sign based hydrogels represent a very promising 3D cell culture platform, which is biocompatible and biodegradable. Methods: In our work, gelatine-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels with a various degree of functionalization were dissolved in different hPL concentrations (0 %, 2.5 %, 50 %, 100 % hPL). The Influence of hPL on proliferation and differentiation of in GelMa encapsulated MSCs were monitored and measured via viability assays, immunocytochemical stainings and microscopy. Furthermore, the influence of hPL addition on mechanical characteristics of GelMA hydrogels was examined by swelling studies and rheometric analysis. Results: The addition of hPL to GelMA hydrogels enhances the cell-spreading, the degree of differentiation as well as cell viability in concentration-depended manner. Besides, the results of the rheometric tests showed an increase of hydrogel stiffness by using higher concentrations of hPL. Discussion: Obtained results demonstrate that supplementation of hydrogels with hPL has a positive effect on cell growth and differentiation. Moreover, hPL can be a promising hydrogel stiffness enhancer for application in 3D bioprinting.
   Objectives: Generally, LVAD thrombosis is diagnosed only by reviewing online logfiles that show an increase of power consumption and flow of the device. In order to increase diagnostic power and improve treatment management, trans-thoracic echocardiography was carried out to assess any blood flow changes. Methods: Eight patients (M 7; F 1) experienced a total of 17 Heart Ware VAD thromboses. At echocardiogram, a 4-chamber view was obtained and the echo probe beam was aligned to blood flow of the inflow cannula. Continous-wave Doppler was applied for the assessment of: 1) the increase of flow maximal velocity (Vmax) above basal ranges over several cardiac cycles and 2) the irregular discontinous sound of the device. Online logfiles were reviewed for abnormal increase in power consumption and flow compared to basal data. All patients underwent thrombolysis with rTPA. Echocardiography results before and after treatment were compared. Results: Thrombolysis was successful in all patients; one patient died due to cerebral haemorrhage. Echocardiograms before thrombolysis showed an increased mean Vmax of 6.4 +/- 0.5 m/sec, whereas after treatment Vmax was 360 +/- 0.2 m/sec (p < 0.001). In all cases irregular, abnormal and discontinuous sounds were heard in thrombosed inflow cannulae. After thrombolysis only washing jet sounds were heard. Before thrombolysis logfiles showed a mean increase of power consumption of 5.6 +/- 0.3 watts, returning to basal values of 3.8 +/- 0.3 watts after thrombolysis (p<0.001). Before thrombolysis logfiles showed mean flow of 6.2 +/- 0.6 L/min, after treatment mean flow was back to normal ranges 4.2 +/- 0.5 L/sec (p<0.001). Discussion: Transthoracic echocardiography showed a significant increase of blood flows in the inflow cannula of thrombosed LVAD devices, confirming findings of log files review. A combined approach by logfiles review and echocardiography is recommended in patients with LVAD thrombosis.
   Objectives: Leukocyte activation is correlated to a reduced immune response in ventricular assist device (VAD) patients. Research has displayed leukocyte microparticle (MP; 200-1000nm diameter) increases following VAD shear stress. However, questions still arise regarding MP role, impact and biogenesis. MPs are plasma membrane derived, but there are smaller (50-100nm diameter), cytoplasmic vesicles (exosomes) which are often overlooked, or mistaken for MPs. As such, unless these vesicles are successfully separated, they should be categorised as extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are known to have roles in cellular communications and implications in diseases, and it is desirable to assess leukocyte sub-sets and any associated roles in VAD complications. Methods: Bovine blood was diluted to a haematocrit of 30 +/- 2% according to ASTM standards. Blood was pumped for 6 hours in vitro with the CentriMag (R) centrifugal pump (Thoratec (R) Corp., USA). Flow cytometry determined a leukocyte EV population, having eliminated cellular debris. Platelet-poor plasma was tested for vesicle size and quantity using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), and immunoblotting conducted for exosome markers. Results: Flow cytometry data displayed an increase in leukocyte death in the CentriMag, correlating to an increase in leukocyte derived EV production. Further analysis determined that these vesicles were mainly monocyte derived, suggesting a potential implication in inflammation. Preliminary NTA and immunoblotting displayed increased EVs following shear, namely exosomes. Discussion: The presence of exosome marker staining and NTA size analysis displays evidence in favour of vesicle increase not being MP specific. As EVs have known implications in inflammation, infection and disease, these results suggest that exosomes may be associated with adverse events in clinical settings. Thus, exosomes should be further examined to elucidate any role as biomarkers of VAD related complications.
   Objectives: To investigate the influence of bone turnover markers in end-stage renal disease patients for severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Methods: 221 ESRD patients with SHPT were split into two groups according to the iPTH level: Mild SHPT group (M-group) (iPTH130 -600 pg/ml, n=86) and severe SHPT group (S-group) (iPTH > 1500pg/ml, n=53). Serum BTM such as beta- CrossLaps (ss-CTX) procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), osteocalcin (OC) were detected. Results: Compared to the M-group, the patients in S-group had higher levels of the ss-CTX (5877.40 +/- 423.01 pg/ml, vs 3206.90 +/- 1438.27), P=0.000, the P1NP (1145.50 +/- 171.36 ug /ml, vs 440.00 +/- 308.12), P=0.000, the OC (258.52 +/- 48.61 ng/ml, vs 221.74 +/- 75.99 ng/ml), P=0.000. ROC Curve analysis for the main risk factors of the parathyroid hyperplasia were ss-CTX, P1NP, sALP, iPTH. Discussion: Severe SHPT had higher levels of bone turnover markers, which may have aggravated CKD-MBD.
   Objectives: One of the main functions of renal replacement therapy is removal of excess products of metabolism from blood. Uremic toxins, waste products found in the blood of patients in need of renal replacement therapy (RRT), have very high blood concentrations and are harmful to the organism. Uremic toxins have been found over 100 and their classification is based on their molecular mass and linkage to proteins. EUTox, the European uremic toxin work group, has divided uremic toxins into 3 groups: water soluble toxins with small molecular mass (MM) < 500 Da (e.g. urea); middle size molecules, MM > 500 Da, (e.g. beta 2-microglobulin); protein-bound uremic toxins (e.g. indoxyl sulphate and rho-cresyl sulfate). Methods: TalTech and a spin-off company grown out of the university, OFT, have developed a new, real-time multicomponent (MCM)-sensor to monitor all uremic toxin groups in RRT. MCM-sensor contains miniature LED-technology to measure UV-absorbance and fluorescence. During online measurements, the sensor is connected to dialysis machine outlet with easy-to-handle connectors. Results: The results from a pilot clinical study at Nephrology Department of North Estonia Medical Centre and Nephrology Department of Linkoping University Hospital will be presented. The outputs of the sensor are on-line concentration patterns of small, middle and protein-bound uremic toxins in the waste dialysis and the clinical parameters of the uremic toxin removal (removal rate, total solute removal). A telemetry application enables to follow the dialytic removal even on remote distances. Discussion: A concept for smart real-time monitoring of intermittent RRT has been realized as a novel miniaturized optical sensor performing intradialytic on-line multicomponent uremic toxins monitoring in the spent dialysate.
   Objectives: Since Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) were shown to enhance neural outgrowth towards them, an approach with a CNT-Silicone rubber compound that immerses the CNTs and thus anchors them to the implant is investigated in an animal model Methods: To compare the CNT-silicone rubber to state-of-the-art neuronal implant materials, 6 variations of the same implant with varying exposed materials were fabricated. The thin-film implants consisted of a polyimide substrate and metal pathways encapsulated in silicone rubber. Depending on the batch, either metal or CNT-silicone rubber were exposed. Female mice were implanted on the brain and under the skin (flank area) for 60 or 180 days. After necropsy, the head was fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde. After 24h, it was stored in 70% ethanol for another 24h and then decalcified. It was then trimmed, dehydrated in ascending alcohol series and xylene. After embedding in Technovit 8100, sections with nominal thickness of 2 mu m were cut. The same procedure was performed on the implants and skin from the flank, except they were embedded in paraffin and cut into 3 mu m slices. Light microscopic examination of Hematoxylin and eosin stained slices was performed. Results: During histopathological examination, both findings associated with surgery and implant-related microscopic changes were observed in sections from the head and flank. The tissue around the implant showed similar reactions in all groups. Macrophages and inflammatory cells as well as slight fibrosis were found around the implant in all animals Discussion: Preparation of tissue sections including thin film implants was shown to be possible, yet the differences in material properties led to problems during cutting. However, usage of different embedding materials for the tissues worked. These first results suggest that the used CNT-Silicone rubber materials could be used in short term applications.
   Objectives: The properties of nanocomposite (NC) poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPAM) hydrogels as well as 3D printing techniques for hydrogels have gained a lot of significance in the tissue engineering community. This study aims at the development of a stable water based ink formulation for nanocomposite hydrogels usable by DLP/SLA 3D-printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm to use them e.g. for investigations in water flows. Methods: Diphenyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (as photo-initiator), Laponite XLG (as nanocomposite crosslinker), sodium dodecyl sulfate (as surfactant) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (as crystallization inhibitor) were dissolved in a N-butyl acetat and isopropanol solution at room temperature. This organic phase was then mixed with bi-distilled water and stirred for 20 minutes in a closed container to form a micro emulsion. The micro emulsion was flash freezed in liquid nitrogen and freeze dried in a Virtis Advantage Plus freeze drying unit for at least 24 h at -50 degrees C and 0.4 mbar. The obtained powder could be dispersed in a NIPAM/water solution to form a stable, UV-curable ink. To show the applicability of hydrogels for investigating flows around bodies in principle, experiments in a water channel will be conducted. Results: The obtained ink is suitable for the most commonly used SLA and DLP printers in the range of 365 - 405 nm. Whereas the expected curing time is much higher than the curing time of commercially available standard polymeric printing inks due to the inhibiting effect of the Laponite XLG. The applicability experiments are in preparation. Discussion: NC-hydrogels obtain through this photo-polymerization method show similar mechanical properties to the standard NC-hydrogels obtained through radical polymerization with potassium peroxodisulfate.
   Objectives: Laser interference lithography (LIL) and the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique are combined here for the first time to design a system with variable nanotopographies and surface viscoelasticity to regulate cell behavior. Methods: LIL is used to generate hexagonally arranged nanostructures of gold with different periodicity. In contrast, LBL is used to assemble a multilayer system of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and hyaluronic acid (HA) on top of the nanostructures. Moreover, the viscoelastic properties of that system are controlled by chemical cross-linking. Results: We show that the topography designed with LIL is still present after multilayer deposition and that the formation of the multilayer system renders the surfaces hydrophilic, which is opposite to the hydrophobic nature of pristine nanostructures. The heterogenic system is applied to study the effect on adhesion and differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSC). We show that hADSC spreading is increasing with cross-linking degree on flat multilayers, while it is decreasing on nanostructures modified with multilayers. In addition, early effects on signal transduction processes are seen. Finally, hADSC differentiation into chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages is superior to adipogenic lineages on nanostructures modified with multilayers. Discussion: Hence, the presented system offers great potential to guide stem cell differentiation on surfaces of implants and tissue engineering scaffolds.
   Objectives: The Gibbs-Donnan theory describes the equilibrium of ionic solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane, when only one solution contains charged macromolecules that cannot pass the membrane. The problem was originally formulated for simple solutions, such as dissociated NaCl, which allowed to calculate the ratio between ions concentrations at the sides of the membrane (Gibbs-Donnan factor). Solutions like plasma and interstitial fluid, and dialysate, contain however ions with different valence, and proteins in each compartment have a different concentration (and therefore charge); the classic theory needs an extension to describe these real-world scenarios. In this study we propose a new method to calculate Gibbs-Donnan factors for such more complex cases. Methods: From electroneutrality considerations and the definition of Nernst potential it is possible to derive a new expression of Gibbs-Donnan factor which depends on the total concentrations of ions of the same valence. This allows, for two solutions A and B, to calculate the concentration of all ions in solution B, given: 1) macromolecule concentrations in A and B, 2) solutes concentrations in A. The transitivity of Donnan factors was proved: for 3 solutions at equilibrium (A, B, C) the factor of A to C is equal to the ratio of the factors from A to B and B to C. Results: As a demonstration, the theory was applied to the calculation of the concentrations in interstitial fluid (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, HCO3-, HPO42-, SO42-, C3H5O3-) starting from values reported in literature. The calculated interstitial concentrations were close to the reported ones, with a global RMSE equal to 6%. Discussion: The Donnan factors for small ions in biological fluids have relatively small deviation from unity, but their precise value may be of importance for ions whose concentrations are similar at both sides of the membrane, as for example sodium and calcium transport in hemodialyzers and peritoneal dialysis.
   Objectives: Biobanking of in vitro engineered tissues presents obvious advantages associated with flexible preparation and shipping scheduling. To provide sufficient cryoprotection, alternative research models, freezing approaches and cryoprotective agents (CPAs) have to be established in view of complexity and diversity of composite tissues. Here, we evaluated the effects of conventional freezing (CF) and directional freezing (DF) for cryopreservation of cell-seeded electrospun fiber mats. Methods: Fiber mats were produced from polycaprolactone and polylactic acid (PCL-PLA, ratio 200:100) using electrospinning. Structure of electrospun mats was characterized using SEM and FTIR, whereas their heat capacity was determined using DSC. The square-shape mats (1x1 cm, UV-sterilized) were seeded with HeLa cells (5x104/scaffold) and cultivated at static conditions. Samples were frozen using 1 K/min to -80 degrees C (CF) or with the directional ice growth at the speed of 30 mu m/sec over a 2.6 mm gradient gap (from -4 to -10 degrees C) i.e. 4 K/min followed by further cooling to -20 degrees C at 1 K/min (translational cryostage) and to -80 degrees C with 1 K/min (LN flow cooling stage). The viability of cells was evaluated 24 h after thawing using fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide staining. Results: PCL-PLA mats exhibited no cytotoxicity on HeLa cells in vitro (viability higher than 90%). Only single cells survived both CF and DF when frozen in culture medium (negative control). In contrast, the majority of cells on fiber mats were alive after freezing under protection of DMSO. Discussion: We showed that although not yet optimized, DF was as effective as CF for cryopreservation of cell-seeded PCL-PLA fiber mats. Preliminary studies on using antifreeze protein Type III (AFPIII) (10 and 100 mu M) as a sole CPA indicates that extracellular protection might not be enough to prevent freezing injury. Our recent work on electroporation of cells within electrospun fiber mats yielded encouraging results and the further initiative will be to deliver AFPs into cells using electroporation to provide DMSO-free cryopreservation of tissue-engineered constructs.
   Objectives: Computational tools for accurate evaluation of healthcare products are increasingly being recognized by the European Parliament, US Congress and FDA and represent a highly valuable tool for speeding up and reducing investments associated with the demanding certification process of medical devices. InSilicoTrials Technologies is developing a collaborative, automatized cloud-based platform to assist medical device and pharma companies in performing modelling and simulation activities to accelerate medical innovation while responding to recommendations of European and US parliaments and regulatory bodies. Methods: Simulations provided by scientific partners are integrated within a secured and privacy-preserved environment, ultimately providing the users (companies, research and clinical centers) with in silico solutions for different steps of the R&D process on medical devices and drugs. Simulation results as well as an automatically created simulation report can be formatted in conformity with guidelines provided by EMA and FDA while taking in consideration the new European Medical Device Regulation. Results: Tools currently hosted on the platform are: NuMRIs, an automatic tool to assess magnetic resonance imaging radio-frequency safety of medical devices, implemented in collaboration with the US FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health and ANSYS. QT/TdP Risk Screen, an automated tool to assess drug-induced pro-arrhythmic and Torsade de Pointes risk of small molecules, developed in collaboration with Universitat Politecnica de Valencia and Fundacio' Institut Mar d'Investigations Mediques. Discussion: The use of computational technologies to support med registration is limited in scope or absent while the agencies are promoting the use of M&S in R&D and registration. This causes a gap in know-how between reality of the industry and regulatory expectations. InSilicoTrials bridges these gaps and helps industries to conform to regulatory recommendations in a timely and cost-effective manner.
   Objectives: Dialyzer design enhancing internal filtration may be beneficial to remove middle molecules from the patient's blood for the treatment of renal pathologies. Mathematical models have been proposed to predict the rate of internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions. However, such models generally consist of difficult differential equations, that may not be easily used and implemented in clinical practice. In this work, an analytical model to predict internal filtration, at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions, is presented. Methods: To identify an analytical formula allowing for the prediction of internal filtration, the Poiseuille equation was used to describe axial momentum transport in the blood and dialysate compartment, assuming constant fluid viscosities, whereas radial momentum transport across the membrane was described with the Darcy equation, assuming linear ultrafiltration flux. The model was validated by comparing the pressure profiles in blood and dialysate compartments, and the rate of internal filtration predicted by the model with experimental data reported in literature for in-house Theranova 400 dialyzer. Results: An analytical formula to predict the rate of internal filtration at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions was obtained. Very good agreement (i.e. percentage error lower than 2%) was found between model predictions and experimental data for blood flow rate increasing from 300 to 400 ml/min, at constant dialyzer flow rate and zero net ultrafiltration flow rate. Good agreement was also found between internal filtration predicted by the analytical model presented in this work, and that predicted by using other one-dimensional mathematical models reported in literature. Discussion: The analytical model presented in this work agrees well with experimental data, and can be used predict the rate of internal filtration at varying dialyzer geometry and operating conditions.
   Objectives: Despite the growing acceptance of LVAD therapy, concerns relating to adverse events have been raised. Fields such as implantation techniques, patient management and patient selection pose opportunities to advance outcomes, however, new and enhanced device technology, such as the ReinVAD LVAD, will have to contribute to improve and grow the therapy. Methods: The ReinVAD GmbH was founded as spin-off company of the Helmholtz-Institute of the RWTH Aachen University, Germany, and leads the development project to regulatory approval and clinical application. The core technology is a miniaturized, 3(rd) generation, centrifugal blood pump. It is the result of a multidisciplinary research and development program equipping the system with features that will improve outcome for bridge to transplantation and especially destination therapy patients. Results: Chronic trials typically up to 90 days in a sheep confirm the capabilities of the system with excellent resistance to thrombogenicity since no design related thrombus could be found despite ceased anti-coagulation after 6 weeks. Implemented features are a pump for partial and full support with flow up to 10 l/min, a fully integrated flow sensor, an implantable driveline connector, a highly pressure-sensitive pump characteristic, an automated speed controller and a user-friendly one-piece extracorporeal system. The sensor provides real flow measurements. The driveline connector ensures easy exchange in case of infections and renders the system ready-for-TET. The pump pressure sensitivity, among other effects, leads to increased exercise capacity and arterial pulsation. The controller ensures that the pump always operates at its optimal speed. The one-piece extracorporeal system reduces use errors and improves satisfaction with this component of everyday life. Discussion: The results indicate that the ReinVAD LVAD will be an effective system to enhance long-term circulatory support therapy.
   Objectives: Cardiovascular diseases shorten life span of hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recently pentraxin 3 (PTX) was considered as a biomarker of cardiac function, as well as an inflammatory biomarker. The aim of this study was to investigate if PTX was a useful biomarker to estimate patients' cardiac condition more than as inflammatory biomarker by analysing plasma in PTX, CRP, NT-pro-BNP (Pro-BNP) and troponin T before and after HD. Methods: Twenty patients on chronic HD were studied in a prospective cross-over study with three modes of HD with polysulfone dialyzers: (a) dry-stored (F8HPS, Fresenius) with a low blood level in the venous chamber (DL), (b) dry-stored with a blood level kept high (DH), and (c) a wet-stored dialyzer (Rexeed18L, Asahi Kasei Medical) with high level (WH). PTX, CRP, Pro-BNP and troponin T were assessed before and during 180 min of HD. Results: The mean value of PTX at baseline was correlated to Pro-BNP (rho=0.52, p<0.001) and troponin T (rho=0.363, p= 0.005), but there was no correlation to CRP. The mean value of PTX was significantly increased at 180 min (by 57%) compared to baseline data (p<0.001). The baseline values of PTX correlated with the extent of rise of PTX (rho=0.89, p<0.001), such as a higher baseline was related with more extensive increase. The mean difference value of PTX between baseline to 180 min of HD was correlated to that of Pro-BNP(rho=0.31, p=0.025), while there was no correlation to that of troponin T nor CRP. PTX rose less while on WH than on DL (mean 2.9 +/- 1.4 vs 3.8 +/- 2.8, p=0.025). There was no difference in PTX at baseline among these three settings. Discussion: These data indicate that PTX is a more evident marker for the influence of the cardiac condition than an inflammatory marker during HD. Dialysis with WH causes least air contamination to the patient what may be a plausible reason for the difference.
   Objectives: Amniotic membrane (AM) is applied in variety of clinical settings, mainly in wound healing and as a biological dressing. Currently, AM is used in ophthalmology for the treatment of cornea pathologies. In this study, the regenerative potential of human amniotic membrane after cryopreservation was evaluated. Methods: AM was prepared under sterile conditions and frozen without cryoprotectants at -80 degrees C. Native non-cryopreserved AM served as a control. The strategy for AM cryopreservation included one or two freezing and thawing cycles. Cytokine and growth factor profiles as well as morphology and mechanical properties of AM were compared before and after one and two cycles of cryopreservation. Levels of EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and Hyaluronic acid were measured by ELISA. Surface structure of the membrane was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphology was evaluated by histological analyses after Hematoxylin Eosin (HE) staining. Additionally, biomechanical characteristics, such as the modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus) and the tensile strength, were also investigated. Results: EGF, HGF, TGF-beta 1, bFGF, Laminin and Hyaluronic acid were detected in all studied samples. No significant differences were detected in the levels of those cytokines before and after cryopreservation. SEM analysis showed minor structural alterations of double cryopreserved samples. Analysis of HE stained AM showed minor changes between native and frozen membranes, such as few areas with desquamated epithelium which was caused by repeating freezing and thawing cycles. Mechanical tests did not reveal relevant changes between frozen and non-frozen samples. Discussion: Multiple cryopreservation steps are an essential part of manufacturing of human amniotic membranes to ensure a ready-to-use product availability. This study demonstrated that the cryopreservation does not impair the regenerative potential of AM required to support its therapeutic efficacy.
   Objectives: Cells are used in bioartificial organs (BAOs) to temporarily replace the complex metabolic functions that neither failing organs, nor their artificial substitutes may provide. This makes cell bioreactors a critical technology for BAOs development. Bioreactors are used for expanding stem (SCs), precursor (PCs), or line cells to clinical mass, for promoting SCs and PCs differentiation to the needed phenotype, and for providing patients with the organ regulatory and synthetic functions needed to foster organ healing or maintain patients state until transplantation (Tx). In some cases, they are also used to regenerate or preserve tissue until Tx. The structural and functional complexity of tissues and organs, the lack of information on their pathophysiology and on disease/damage evolution, the treatment time broadly varying with patients disease and state, all make bioreactor design and operation for BAOs very challenging. Methods: In spite of its complexity, cell bioreactors design for BAOs is generally based on the use of one cell type only (often line cells), scaffolds with suitable immune protective properties, and bioreactor configurations suitable for hosting clinical cell mass and intellectual property protection. Bioreactor performance has been enhanced with actuators to provide cells with mechanical, electrical and/or magnetic cues, often irrespective of tissue or organ specificity. Thus far, this approach has resulted in poor therapeutic success of the proposed BAOs. Results: Cell bioreactor design for BAOs may benefit of the approaches developed over the years to bioreactor design for engineering or regenerating 3D tissue or large solid organs in vitro. Discussion: Prospectively, future approaches to cell bioreactor design for BAOs should be patterned after those typical of tissue engineering and should aim to the optimization of the BAO treatment as a whole.
   Objectives: To find the most appropriate lock solution for central venous catheters to prevent catheter-related complications. Methods: Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched up to August 2018. We included randomized controlled trials comparing different lock solutions for adult dialysis patients (> 18 years old). The trials should report at least one primary or secondary outcome. Network meta-analyses of outcomes were performed using the netmeta 0.9-6 package in R (version 3.5.1). Other analyses were carried out by means of the network and network graphs packages in Stata version 15.0. Results: 50 trials (7142 patients) were included for this study. Compared with heparin 5000U/ml, antibiotic locks (antibiotics with TSC, EDTA, heparin 5000U/ml, low-dose heparin, or urokinase) and ethanol locks were more effective in preventing catheter-related bloodstream infections. Antimicrobial agents plus low-dose heparin (500-2500 U/ml), TSC and low-dose heparin locks had lower risk of bleeding events than heparin 5000 U/ml. No lock solution reduced rates of catheter malfunction and all-cause mortality compared with heparin 5000 U/ml. In summary, antibiotics plus low-dose heparin was ranked as the best lock solution. Considering the toxicity and drug resistance of antibiotics, ethanol could be the alternative antimicrobial lock solution. The overall results were not materially changed in sensitivity analyses. Discussion: In total, according to the two-dimensional graph, antimicrobial agents plus low-dose heparin (500-2500 U/ml) was the highest ranking lock solution, as it reduced the rates of CRBSI and the risk of bleeding significantly. Ethanol was the promising alternative antimicrobial lock solution of antibiotics to combine with anticoagulant agents. TSC alone did not prevent CRBSI, but it is safe.
   Objectives: The Fontan procedure is the current standard and the best palliative treatment for most patients with a functional univentricular heart. During the Fontan procedure the caval veins are anastomosed to the pulmonary arteries. The resulting total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) allows for the support of an acceptable level of pulmonary circulation. At the same time there is the high risk of cardiovascular system failure due to the increased load on a single ventricle. In order to increase patient survival and quality of life, the different TCPC connections aimed at improving blood hemodynamic seems to be a logical treatment option. Methods: A CFD study was carried out for four types of TCPC (TCPC-1, TCPC-2, TCPC-3, TCPC-4) to determine the optimal connection from the point of view of hydraulic and power losses with and without the rotary blood pump (RBP) connected. The distribution of scalar shear stresses (SSS) in the volume was calculated, allowing for evaluation of the effect of the RBP on the blood at the operating point of 2.2 l/min and 11 mmHg of head pressure. Results: The results showed that the TCPC-3 connection has the optimal geometry, as there is a decrease in hydraulic losses corresponding to 5 mmHg, with power losses of 0.055 W. Hydraulic losses and power losses for other types of TCPC are equal to 6 mmHg and 0.07 W for TCPC-2, 9 mmHg and 0.08 W for TCPC-4, 10 mmHg and 0.09 W for TCPC-1 respectively. The geometry optimization of the TCPC connection can significantly reduce the system losses, but only the integration of the RBP prevents these losses even for non-optimal TCPC. Discussion: Although the use of a pump has significantly reduced losses, the presence of increased SSS can have a negative effect on blood. The obtained values of SSS will allow in the future the estimation of the degree of blood damage and, as a consequence, hemolysis level.
   Objectives: The complex tree-like architecture of the lungs that ends with tiny alveolar sacs is difficult to mimic in-vitro. The delicate and ultra-thin alveolar barrier with its air-liquid interface is constantly exposed to the rhythmic respiratory movements. We report here about two organs-on-chip models that uniquely reproduce this environment and in which patients 'cells are cultured. A first model recapitulates an array of alveoli with in-vivo dimensions using a biological stretchable membrane. The second model mimics a functional lung capillary network. Methods: The key part of the lung alveolar model is a biological membrane made of collagen and elastin (CE) that is pipetted on a gold mesh, whose pores correspond to the alveolar size (about 200um). Once the dried CE-membrane is rehydrated, primary human cells (alveolar epithelial and endothelial) can be cultured on both sides. The second model is based on the self-assembly of endothelial cells and pericytes that are confined in fibrin gel in microengineered compartments. Results: A functional alveolar barrier made of primary human alveolar epithelial cells and lung endothelial cells is reported. The CE-membrane, on which the cells are cultured, is thin (a few micrometers), porous (enables the culture of cells at the air-liquid interface during several days), and stretchable. The reported lung microvasculature made of self-assembled endothelial cells and pericytes is perfusable, vasoactive (contracts in presence of phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor) and is permeable. Discussion: These advanced in-vitro models enable mimicking the lung parenchymal environment in an unprecedented way. As a result, the cultured tissues made of primary human lung cells are able to maintain organ-specific functions, such as air-blood barrier tightness and microvascular perfusability and contractility. Organs-on-chip solutions, such as those presented here, may open new possibilities for specific tissue engineering applications.
   Objectives: Development of simple and effective technologies for cell storage at positive temperatures facilitates to extend their use and ensures safe transport between research and clinical centers. The aim is to study the viability and metabolic activity of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) encapsulated in alginate microspheres (AMS) during storage at positive temperatures. Methods: The experiments were performed on human dermal MSCs derived from adult donors after their informed consent. MSCs in suspension and in AMS were stored in sealed cryovials at 4, 22 and 37 degrees C. Cell viability and metabolic activity were evaluated by MTT- and AlamarBlue-tests and the ability to adhere to the culture plastic. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed with fluorescent dye JC-1. Differentiation potential was evaluated after cells induction to osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Results: Encapsulation in AMS supported viability and metabolic activity of MSCs during storage in culture medium at ambient temperature at list for 3 days. Storage of MSCs under hypothermic conditions (4 degrees C) using special media contributed to a longer sustainability of cell viability. During storage alginate encapsulated cells retained the ability to multilineage differentiation, but had lower metabolic activity and mitochondrial membrane potential than cells in monolayer. On release from alginate microspheres, the cells were shown to attach, reverse metabolic activity and proliferate in a similar manner to that seen before encapsulation. Discussion: Encapsulation in alginate microspheres may be considered as a cheap and robust alternative to cryopreservation for the shirt-term storage and transport of cells for clinical and research projects.
   Objectives: In case of organ failure, several options can theoretically be considered, thanks to the progresses in medicine, materials science and biotechnology: i) transplant the same organ from a donor, ii) replace the functions of the failing organ by an artificial one, iii) repair its structure thanks to cell therapy or iv) engineer a new one in vitro before its implantation. Methods: As far as abdominal organs (kidney, liver, pancreas), the history of organ replacement follows different ways that will be considered. In addition to medical and scientific hurdles, economical or ethical issues can drive the choices for the "best" solution for the patient. Results: The case of pancreas is very specific since its transplantation is not the first option chosen to treat the failing organs, whereas it represents the gold standard for the liver and the kidney. In the case of liver, we still have to face the lack of purely artificial organ to treat acute liver failure or even chronic disease. Discussion: This is due to the complexity of the organs and the variety of its functions, some of them remaining relatively unknown. In this case, the option of engineering new liver in vitro combining hepatic cells of different phenotypes with an adequate matrix allowing high blood perfusion appears as the most promising option. Several approaches have been proposed, starting from the "basic" use of a semi-permeable hollow fiber membrane to host the cells to the bioprinting of the whole organ. We will discuss here the pros and cons of these different strategies.

   Objectives: Intraventricular flow patterns during mechanical circulatory support (MCS) cannot be accessed by clinical imaging; therefore, either computational or in-vitro models are used. However, the complex anatomy of the heart cannot be replicated and simulations inherently rely on assumptions and simplifications. In an isolated porcine heart setup the feasibility of flow measurements by Echocardiographic Particle Image Velocimetry (E-PIV) was evaluated. Methods: Similar to cardiac transplantation, porcine hearts (n=8, animal weight: 80-106 kg) were excised and connected to the isolated heart setup. After resuscitation using blood as perfusate, a rotary blood pump was implanted, microbubbles were injected via the left atrium at different support situations and echocardiographic 3-chamber-view B-mode images were recorded with the highest possible frame rate of up to 141 Hz (Philips iE33, X5-1 xMatrix probe). By iterative PIV algorithms using correlation domain averaging and beam sweep correction, flow fields were evaluated for the different hemodynamic situations. Results: All hearts were successfully resuscitated in the isolated heart setup and different hemodynamic situations were adjusted. In the unsupported heart physiologic flow patterns with a large clockwise vortex structure that warrants washout of the whole cardiac chamber were found. With increasing MCS (2200-2700 rpm) the formation of this flow feature is diminished caused by the additional flow sink at the apex. In full support, without aortic valve opening in the left ventricular outflow tract, a stagnant structure was identified, that might be connected to thromboembolic events. Discussion: For the first time, the contribution of the mitral valve apparatus to blood flow patterns especially in the LVOT, which may be linked to energy loss, thrombus formation and valve deterioration during MCS was investigated under realistic conditions.
   Objectives: In order to determine the most effective ratio of liver cells (LC) and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells of bone marrow (MSC BM) into implantable cell-engineering constructs (CECs) used for a correcting of chronic liver failure (CLF). Methods: In order to create liver CECs we employed a biopolymer implant - a composition of a heterogeneous collagen-containing gel, which concluded viable LC and MSC BM in ratios:1:1, 5:1 and 10:1 respectively. CECs with different ratios of LC and MSC BM were implanted into the livers of rats (n=40) in which CLF was modeled by using CCl4. The efficiency of the regulatory effects of CECs (with different cell ratios) on regenerative processes in livers were assessed by using biochemical, morphological and morphometric methods at different periods after their implantation. Results: During studying of the liver CECs with various ratios of LC and MSC BM (1:1, 5:1, 10:1), it was found that the most optimal ratio of cells into the CECs was 5:1, because at such ratio of cells the most distinct normalization of morphological and functional liver parameters as well as maintenance of the structural homeostasis within the CECs took place within 365 days after modeling CLF. Discussion: The effective correction of CLF can be carried out by using the implanted liver CECs, in which donor liver cells and MSC BM are presented in ratios - 1:1, 5:1 and 10:1. But analysis of prolonged correction of liver morphological and functional parameters at CECs using allows to recommend the preference using of CECs using with ratio 5:1, because prolonged preservation of structural homeostasis into themselves CECs makes possible to prognosticate their prolonged regulatory action on the liver tissue at CLF, especially for recipients on a waiting list for liver transplantation.
   Conventional hemolysis researches were performed under mainly constant shear stress, however, real flow in vivo would be under fluctuating shear stress. In addition, several conventional numerical simulations predicted abrupt shear stress fluctuation in the blood pumps in short time period. Furthermore, it was also reported that erythrocyte showed its unique viscoelastic shape change response to sinusoidal changing shear stress. Based on such information, we hypothesized that abrupt shear change would be additional hemolysis factor in addition to conventional shear stress and its exposure time. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of such our hypothesis. We developed special cylindrical shear chamber which can generate varying shear stress by controlling the rotational speed. This study used the shear device to generate several trapezoidal waveforms of shear stresses. In such shear fluctuation, the maximal shear stress of approximate 22.5 Pa were loaded to porcine whole blood for 5.0 seconds. And the time series integrated shear stress was set to equal between abrupt and slow shear change conditions. Then, generated hemolysis levels were compared between them. Each comparative studies were performed for twelve times. Furthermore, such studies were repeated under several different shear change speeds. The result of our all comparison showed greater hemolysis amount at abruptly fluctuating shear condition. Such results successfully validated our hypothesis.
   Objectives: Ex vivo platelet production in microfluidic bioreactors is a promising alternative to platelet donation for transfusion therapy. Platelets are formed by fragmentation of large bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes (MK). Hydrodynamic forces play a major role in the formation of platelets. In this work, we design microfluidic chips where isolated MK are exposed to hydrodynamic forces and we characterize their elongation and fragmentation. Methods: Polydimethylsiloxane chips are fabricated using standard soft lithography protocols and sealed to a glass slide. The 50 mu m deep rectangular chambers contain rows of 30 mu m-wide adhesive pillars. Human CD34+ cells isolated from umbilical cord blood are differentiated in vitro for 12 days to yield mature MK and infused with a concentration of 2x10(5) /mL into the chips at a wall shear rate of 1800s(-1). Their elongation and fragmentation is monitored by videomicroscopy. Images were analysed using ImageJ. Results: We perform a spatio-temporal analysis of MK elongation and show that platelet release is always preceded by a remodeling of the cell that spans over about 20 minutes, followed by a local, sudden increase in elongation velocity (5-fold increase in the 10 seconds prior to fragmentation). The amplitude of these variations is much larger than the spatial and temporal variations in the surrounding flow field. Discussion: Earlier studies have shown that dynamic conditions for in vitro platelet production not only accelerates the process but also enhances the quality of released platelets. Here, we show that MK elongation and fragmentation, though accelerated by the flow, are not solely governed by fluid-structure interactions. It seems that other mechanisms are involved in the regulation of platelet release, preventing it to occur before the platelet is fully functional.
   Objectives: The Eulerian version of the strain-based hemolysis model has already shown to predict different critical regions in blood pumps compared to the commonly used stress-based models. Where the stress-based model assumes an instantaneous deformation of red blood cells (RBCs) due to the action of fluid forces, the strain-based model is able to estimate the viscoelastic deformation of RBCs. Thus, the effect of exposure time is considered in a natural way. However, both models are based on the empirical power law assumption for hemoglobin transport and turned out to overpredict hemolysis compared to experimental data. In order to improve the prediction of free-plasma hemoglobin, the strain-based model is combined with a multiscale model for hemoglobin transport. The model is able to account for pore formation in the RBC membrane and the resulting hemoglobin mass transfer into the blood plasma. Thus, the model does not rely on the power law assumption. Methods: The formation of pores is computed based on an energy balance of the stretched RBC membrane, where an area strain can be computed by the tensor equation of the strain-based model. The hemoglobin release is modeled by a transport equation with a mass transfer coefficient as a function of shear, which can be fitted to the data of blood shearing experiments. As an application, the model is used for a benchmark blood pump provided by the FDA. Results: The estimated total hemolytic performance for the benchmark blood pump is significantly reduced compared to the power law version of the strain-based model. The new results are in good agreement with the measured data by the FDA. Discussion: The multiscale model for hemoglobin transport turns out to be a useful extension of the strain-based hemolysis model, allowing for an overall more physical model description of the hemolysis process. Application to different devices and blood shearing experiments should be investigated in the future, in order to study the parameter sensitivity.
   Objectives: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane enclosed structures, which are released from all types of cells upon activation. Two examples for the role of EVs in extracorporeal therapies will be discussed in detail, (i) EVs as markers for cellular activation and (ii) EVs as platform for the binding of plasma proteins. We assessed the impact of regional citrate anticoagulation (2.8 vs. 5.6 mM) on the cellular activation in lipoprotein apheresis, using EVs as marker for cellular activation upon blood-adsorbent interaction. Moreover, we studied the ability of a commercial adsorbent (PentraSorb) for C-reactive protein (CRP) to remove both, soluble and EV-associated CRP from septic plasma. Methods: EVs were characterized in human blood or plasma via flow cytometry after calibration with fluorescent silica beads (1 mu m, 0.5 mu m, 0.3 mu m; Kisker Biotech). Phosphatidylserine-exposing EVs were identified as lactadherin-positive events in the EV gate. Antibodies against cell specific surface markers (CD41 for platelets, CD235a for red blood cells) were used to identify the cellular origin of EVs. An anti-CRP antibody was used to identify CRP carrying EVs. Results: During lipoprotein apheresis, platelet adhesion to the adsorbent polymer and EV release were associated with elevated markers for platelet activation and EV release was dependent on the citrate concentration in the extracorporeal circuit. Septic plasma contained significantly elevated levels of EVs, CRP+ EVs, as well as soluble CRP as compared to healthy donors. Incubation of plasma with the CRP adsorbent resulted in almost complete depletion of soluble CRP, and remaining EVs did not show any association with CRP, indicating detachment of CRP from the EVs. Discussion: In the context of apheresis, EVs can be considered as markers for cellular activation. Moreover, our data show that EVs can serve as a platform for the binding of CRP, which has been suggested to induce conformational changes of CRP and a shift towards pro-inflammatory characteristics.
   Objectives: In developing endovascular treatment devices, understanding their physical properties is one of the most important points. We have been developed film-type sensor for force measurement, applied to the field of biomechanics. In this study, the blood vessel model embedded pressure film sensor was fabricated and the contact pressure distribution in the circumferential direction was measured at balloon dilatation. Methods: The film sensor was constructed by a couple of patterned electrodes and pressure-sensitive layer. The film sensor was rolled and embedded to straight-shape silicone vessel model. The balloon catheter was expanded in a mock vessel. Results: The measured pressure at the mock vessel increased according to balloon dilatation pressure. At expanding of general balloon, the measured pressure at each point was almost the same. When expanding a scoring balloon, a balloon with wedge elements, the measured pressure at wedge contact points was higher than that of the other parts. Discussion: It is considerable that stress concentration state changes depending on the wedge shape and/or stiffness. The mock vessel is useful to understand dilatation property of scoring balloon.
   Objectives: Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat acute respiratory and circulatory failure. Recent advancements have led to impressive improvements in treatment results. Now clinicians urge for an ever-earlier ECMO application and a broadening of the indications: Mobility demand -> Every ECMO patient needs to be transported under severely restricted space conditions. Cost demand -> With rising ECMO numbers the cost ratio plays an increasing role for healthcare economics. Methods: A novel system uses a recombination of existing technologies to create a straightforward solution with a size and complexity reduction. The key principle is the sourcing of pump energy from the oxygen pressure, which is required to ventilate the oxygenator anyway. This modification allows a purely pneumatic operation and the usage of pulsatile pumps. Results: A pneumatically powered dual chamber pulsatile pump has been developed which avoids suction and high shear rates with improved wash out behaviour for the entire ECC system. The innovative pump is driven completely pneumatically without a complex and expensive driving console. Furthermore, a novel oxygenator has been developed. Initial prototypes of pumps and oxygenators have been optimized during multiple design iterations and tested in terms hydraulic characteristics and gas exchange properties on the bench using water glycerol and porcine blood. The entire system has a reduced surface area and priming volume and shows low internal pressure loss, excellent wash out and gas exchange parameters. The bench test results have been confirmed within a chronic GLP in vivo study in large animals. The new device's size and complexity have been significantly reduced compared to the state of the art systems. Discussion: The novel approach brings many advantages for the next generation ECMO/ECLS systems particularly in terms of function, mobility and cost-effectiveness.
   Objectives: The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards recommend bovine blood for in vitro testing of medical devices. Haemodilution is used to standardise haematocrit (HCT) to 30 +/- 2% with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Research has shown that PBS increases red blood cell mechanical fragility and significantly increases haemolysis. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of diluent and dilution for in vitro testing, which may result in future considerations for ASTM standards. Methods: Bovine blood was diluted with either PBS or PBS+4g% BSA (bovine serum albumin) to a HCT of 30 +/- 2%. The blood was either pumped with the CentriMag (R) (Thoratec,USA) device under haemodynamic conditions or exposed to VAD-like shear for 6 hours. Blood was diluted to a range of 70-94% (n=40). Plasma free haemoglobin levels were measured to calculate the normalised index of haemolysis (NIH). Protein concentrations were measured. Results: Haemodilution altered mechanical fragility depending on diluent and concentration. At a 70% blood dilution, PBS alone caused significantly higher haemolysis than PBS+4g% BSA. However, at a 90% blood dilution, PBS+4g% BSA caused significantly higher haemolysis than PBS alone. As such, a positive correlation was observed between dilution with PBS alone and NIH, whereas a negative correlation was observed between dilution with PBS+4g% BSA and NIH. Total protein concentration was significantly reduced at a 70% blood dilution with PBS alone but not at 90%. Discussion: To reach a HCT of 30%+/- 2%, this study recommends that bovine blood with a HCT of > 37% should be diluted with PBS + 4g% BSA (>80% blood dilution), whereas blood with a HCT of <37% should be diluted with PBS alone (<80% blood dilution). Haemodilution with BSA maintains physiological protein concentrations and may reduce bias during haemolysis testing with high dilutions. Thus, ASTM standards could consider including BSA as a diluent, when needed.
   Objectives: Obtaining normal serum potassium level is an important goal in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Hyperkalemia is known to be associated with mortality. In this study we aimed to access the relationship between pre-dialysis potassium level, nutritional status and survival in dialysis patients. Methods: This study used annual cohort of hemodialysis patients with 36 months of follow up. To determine the impact of potassium level on mortality, patients were followed from first potassium measurement until death or a censoring event; hypokalemia was defined by potassium levels below 5.5 mmol/l and albumin levels below 35g/l was considered an index for undernourished. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate the association between potassium level and mortality. Results: 199 patients were included in the study. Mean age was approximately 56 years, about 59% were men and 23% had end-stage renal disease caused by diabetes. Albumin below 35g/l was observed in 26 (13%) of the patients. In the follow up period 40 (20%) patients died, comprising 24 (32%) of the 74 hypokalemic and 16 (19%) of 82 hyperkalemic patients. The Kaplan-Meier survival rate was significantly longer in the hyperkalemic population (34.30 +/- 0.71 vs 31.06 +/- 1.16, p=0.055). Hypokalemia, when defined as serum potassium 5.5 pound mmol/l, was associated with all-cause mortality (hazards ratio (HR) 1.857, 95% CI 0.986-3.496, p = 0.051). The significance was lost in the model after adjustment for albumin level. Only albumin level determined mortality (p=0.03). Discussion: Lower potassium level was associated with all-cause mortality, but only as a confounding effect of malnutrition in dialysis patients
   Objectives: A new method to adhere biological tissue to another or to metal such as stainless steel using integrated low-level energy sources, heat, pressure, and vibration is proposed. Methods: Heat, pressure, and vibration are simultaneously delivered by pressing the porcine aorta tissues on the vibration plate with the heated tip. Tensile tests on adhered specimens were performed to determine adhesion characteristics to adhesion temperature, time, pressure, and vibration. The effect of metal surface coating, fluorine-doped DLC coating, on the adhesion strength was examined. In one application, the inlet port of a ventricular assist device adhered to a porcine ventricle muscle by applying the novel method with a temperature of 80 degrees Centigrade for 120 seconds. Sufficient adhesion was observed without additional vibration. In a second application, the vessel adhesion apparatus was developed to connect a bypass graft to a coronary artery. The device has both a heating and pressurizing part on the tip, which was used to attach the bypass graft to the coronary artery by applying heat with a temperature of 120 degrees Centigrade for 120 seconds. Results and Discussion: The maximal shear tensile strength using the proposed novel adhesion method was 200 kPa, which is half the strength of the porcine aorta. Adhesion strength increased in proportion to temperature, time, and pressure. The adhesion strength can be controlled by surface treatment of metals. In the first application, the inlet port adhered to the ventricle muscle with a shear tensile strength of 91 kPa, which is enough to keep the pump attached to the ventricle. In the second application, the bypass graft adhered to the coronary artery with a shear tensile strength of 50 kPa, which is sufficient to maintain attachment when exposed to normal blood pressure. The proposed adhesion method indicates satisfactory performance.
   Objectives: The requirements for safety and efficacy of medical devices are constantly increasing leading to higher costs and time to market. Simulations are proving to be particularly promising in accelerating the approval process and at the same time further increasing patient safety. The FDA related Medical Device Innovation Consortium predicts that in some years about 40% of the evidences for regulatory approval are coming from virtual patients and simulations. What is the status today and how do we get there? Methods: Simulations can improve the regulatory assessment in various phases of the product life cycle, e.g. to justify design adjustments, worst-case estimates of sizes and variants, definition of test loads for experiments, to perform virtual tests on a large number of patients/conditions or to identify the root cause of failure. This may especially be important in consideration of the future requirements of the MDR for patient-specific implants. Results: So far, the use of simulations was hindered by a lack of guidance and expectations within the medical device community. However, today the FDA and ASME are strongly supporting the use of this approach with new guidelines (guidance 1807) and a V&V standard (V&V40). "FDA's Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories has committed significant resources for transforming computational modeling from a valuable scientific tool to a valuable regulatory tool because of its potential for significant cost-savings in evaluating medical devices, simulating performance under scenarios that may not be possible with human use or that could more effectively be evaluated with simulation." Discussion: Computer-aided simulations have the potential to revolutionize the field of regulatory approval. However, it is crucial that the simulations are performed with care and its limitations are understood. To foster confidence and wider acceptance of in silico methods, a proper methodology is needed to ensure appropriate credibility.
   Objectives: TAVI is the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis in elderly patients or in patients with too high risk for conventional surgery. CT-scan is mandatory for valve sizing. It requires injection of contrast medium that may cause or increase kidney failure. The study aim was to establish the accuracy of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), a no contrast medium technique, for measurements of native aortic valve in patients undergoing TAVI. Values by IVUS were compared to CT-scan ones in the same patients. Methods: From June 2014 to January 2019 137 consecutive patients (74 M, mean age 82.7 +/- 5.6 years) (Logistic EuroSCORE 22.7 +/- 14.9%; STS score mortality 21.3 +/- 13.7%) undergoing TAVI through femoral access were enrolled. Each patient had high resolution angio-CT for these measurements: diameter, perimeter, and area of the aortic annulus. In all patients, during procedure and before prosthetic valve implantation, a manual IVUS pullback, from left ventricular outflow tract to ascending aorta, was performed by 7F IVUS probe. On the recorded IVUS pullback, a second operator blind to CT measures sized minimum and maximum diameter, perimeter and area of the aortic annulus. In order to assess inter-rater concordance and agreement between CT and IVUS data, Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson's correlation were applied. A p value Results: A very strong correlation was found between the measures. Maximum diameter: CT 2.5 +/- 0.3 vs IVUS 2.6 +/- 0.3 cm; r=+0.985; pDiscussion: These results prove the accuracy and reliability of aortic annulus measurements by IVUS compared to those by CT-scan. Sizing of the aortic annulus by IVUS only may be considered in patients likely to develop kidney failure due to contrast medium injection.
   Objectives: The long-term usage of rotary blood pumps is limited by the high amount of blood damage, which leads to a high number of adverse events. Most of the blood damage is generated in the gap between the rotor blades and the housing wall, the area with the highest stress load and very short exposure times. The damage is caused by both shear and normal forces on the blood components. The objective is to investigate the blood damage in this region by examining different gap geometries. The focus is the damage caused by high dynamic normal stresses and the comparison with the blood damage models. Methods: A section of the blade gap of an axial rotary blood pump was reconstructed on a microchannel chip, which is sealed with siliconized cover glasses. In additional channels the inlet and outlet rounding are varied between 0.05 and 0.6 mm. The gap length and width are kept the same for all channels. A channel without a blade gap is integrated to determine the damage caused by the test stand. Flow simulations are carried out to determine the occurring stresses. The test stand consists of a syringe pump that transports 20 mL of human blood back and forth through the microchannels for up to 6 hours. Hemolysis is measured every half hour. Results: With the test stand it is possible to investigate the influence of different gap geometries on the blood damage under controlled conditions. The experiments demonstrated the influence of different inlet and outlet geometries on the hemolysis. The measured hemolysis was compared with the damage models. Discussion: With the test stand it is possible to simulate the stress loads in blade gaps on human blood. The influence of the high dynamic normal stresses on hemolysis can also be determined through variations of the inlet and outlet. It is therefore a well-suited tool for improving the corresponding damage models in the area of high dynamic stress loads. The findings allow the optimization of the region to further reduce blood damage caused by rotary blood pumps.
   Objectives: Cardiac grafts produced by combining human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derivatives and tissue engineering are a promising therapeutic option for the replacement of cardiomyocytes (CM) lost due to myocardial infarction. Currently, the vascularization and maturation of such grafts are the most critical aspects. In addition to endothelial cells (EC), pericytes (PC) are known to play a crucial role in vessel development and stabilization. Methods: Here, an hPSC-derived PC differentiation protocol is shown as well as an in vitro model for the investigation of the role of PCs in hPSC-derived bioartificial cardiac tissues (BCT). Results: In the established differentiation protocol, the population giving rise to PCs (CD31-/PDGFR beta+) represented up to 94% of all cells and could be further purified via cell sorting. The obtained hPSC-PCs exhibited functional characteristics of PCs in co-culture assays, and showed similar gene expression profile to primary PCs. Differentiated hPSC-PCs were used w/ or w/o purified hPSC-ECs to generate BCTs and to address their effect on tissue morphology, metabolism, and electrophysiological parameters compared to control tissues containing primary fibroblasts (Fb). Interestingly, tissues with hPSC-PCs exhibited equivalent contraction forces compared to controls, but more organized sarcomere structures as well as improved longitudinal cell- and extracellular matrix orientation. Furthermore, the beating frequency and passive forces showed native-like values. Addition of hPSC-ECs resulted in spontaneously formed and maintained endothelial network structures, which were distributed throughout the BCTs and the involvement of PCs in such structures was demonstrated. Discussion: The characterized and functional hPSC-PCs together with hPSC-derived CMs and ECs represent a promising cell source for myocardial tissue replacement therapy. Their dual ability in supporting EC function and matrix remodeling during tissue maturation makes them a favorable candidate to replace primary Fbs.
   Objectives: High prevalence of thrombi around the Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) cannula has been proven by pathological studies. Thrombogenic potential (TP) inside of the left ventricle (LV) is evaluated based on shear stress history (SSH) and residence time (RT) of particles; however, the effect of the atrial inflow - including rotation and uneven flow distribution of the pulmonary veins - is ignored. In this study, the influence of the atrial inflow on the TP was investigated via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Methods: In a patient-specific left ventricle (LV) model under full LVAD support, the flow fields were simulated with three different inflow conditions: with perpendicular velocity to the inflow (LAper, flow rate: 3.5l/min), with an additional rotational component at the inflow (LArot: 35rpm) and with asymmetric inflow conditions (LAasym: 60%/40% left/right). Platelet motion was simulated with a combination of laminar and the Lagrangian methods for 7s. The TP value was calculated based on the RT and SSH of particles (0<TP<1, with higher values corresponding to higher risk). Results: The ventricular flow patterns were comparable for perpendicular and rotational inflows and different for asymmetric conditions. TP values were different for each of the atrial inflow conditions (LAasym: 0.37, LArot: 0.35, LAper: 0.4). The number of the particles with a SSH value more than 0.6 Pa center dot s (non-outlier range) increased for LAasym simulation (LAasym: 11%, LArot: 5%, LAper: 3%;p<0.05); however the particles that remain for more than 7s inside the LV were higher for LAper simulation (LAasym: 13%, LArot: 18%, LAper: 19%;p<0.05). Discussion: CFD is an advanced tool for the evaluation of ventricular flow during LVAD support; however, neglecting the atrial inflow conditions could lead to an inaccurate prediction of flow parameters linked to ventricular and pump thrombosis. Reliable evaluation of ventricular blood flow, therefore, requires the consideration of realistic atrial inflow conditions.
   Objectives: Thrombus formation is a major risk of implants with artificial materials in blood contact. This adhesion of blood platelets plays an important role in thrombus formation and is influenced by the electrochemical conditions of the surface. The objective of this research is to change the electrochemical conditions by applying a low voltage, high frequency alternating electrical current to the surface, in order to avoid the adhesion of the platelets involved in thrombus formation. Methods: Thin sheet samples with a thickness of 0.5 mm from different materials (titanium, stainless steel and copper) are attached to a high frequency generator and exposed to human whole blood under controlled flow conditions in an in vitro setting. An electrical current ranging from 50 mu A until 400 mu A in a frequency range from 10 kHz to 100 kHz was applied. The deposition of the blood platelets on the surface is identified and quantified by using fluorescent microscopy and digital image processing. The thrombus formation and therefore the anti-thrombogenic effect of the method is investigated in respect to different generator settings for each material. Results: The characterization of all materials revealed changes of the surfaces in comparison to the zero samples. A differently pronounced reduction of thrombus formation with the proposed anti-thrombogenic method could be demonstrated on all three materials. Discussion: Though the method could improve the anti-thrombogenicity under certain conditions, the mechanism is not fully understood yet and the parameters are not optimized. Further investigations will also focus on possible side effects caused by potential structural changes of blood proteins.
   Objectives: Cationic liposomes OO4 (N-{6-amino-1-[N-(9Z) -octadec9-enylamino] -1-oxohexan-(2S) -2-yl} -N0- {2- [N, N-bis(2-aminoethyl) amino] ethyl} -2-hexadecylpropandiamide) and DOPE contain a higher amount of amino groups than classical lipids. A polyelectrolyte multilayer system (PEM) made of chondroitin sulphate (CS) and collagen type I (COL I) was prepared by Layer-by-Layer technique with liposomes embedded in the terminal layers for the controlled release of components to promote osteogenic differentiation for bone regeneration. Methods: Characterization of the PEM was performed using ellipsometry. This technique was used to investigate the thickness on substrate coated with PEM of CS, liposomes, COL I as terminal layer. The layer growth behavior of PEM was studied using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The cell adhesion of C2C12 cells and the cellular uptake efficiency of the liposomes embedded onto PEM was evaluated using fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. Results: The SPR results showed a linear growth with an increase in the angle shift corresponding to the adsorbed mass of PEM. The increase in thickness after liposome adsorption was significant. The cell studies indicated that cells seeded on terminal liposome layer showed a higher amount of cells on the surface. The population of cells that took up liposomes are higher in the absence of serum than in medium with FBS. Discussion: The quantification of liposome uptake indicated that the population of cells that took up liposomes were higher in the absence of serum. The results showed the uptake efficiency of cationic liposomes embedded onto a PEM system for controlled release of hydrophobic and hydrophilic models compounds into the cells.
   Objectives: Many different tissue sealants are available on the market. BioGlue tissue sealants are produced by a bovine serum albumin treated intra-operatively with glutaraldehyde. Here we report a sterile peri-graft abscess formation, possibly caused as a reaction to the liberal use of BioGlue. Methods: A-54 years-old male patient underwent ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. Exceptionally, the anastomotic suture line was reinforced by application of BioGlue tissue sealant. The initial post-operative course was uneventful. After transfer to the general ward on day four the patient developed fever and an inflammatory syndrome. A broad spectrum antibiotherapy was started for a suspicion of pneumonia. In the following chest CT scan a suspicious peri-graft fluid collection was present. The patient underwent a surgical revision for acute mediastinitis rule out. During the procedure a whitish-milky liquid was found that differed macroscopically from a classical abscess. The chest was left open with a negative-pressure wound dressing. The patient became apyretic and the inflammatory markers normalized. After a one week follow-up with negative cultures and 3 consecutive dressing changes, the chest was closed and recovery uneventful. The patient was discharged to an outside hospital at six post-operative days. Results: All the samples which were analysed histologically and for different pathologic stains as well as and by broad spectrum culture analysis, remained negative throughout. At one month follow-up the patient remained well and without fever or inflammatory response. Discussion: Although several published case reports about tissue necrosis and anastomotic rupture following BioGlue use, the formation of a sterile abscess is a rare complication. In this patient, the peri-graft effusion might have been an allergy like inflammatory response to the bovine albumin within BioGlue. A prolonged postoperative mediastinal drainage when using BioGlue might prevent this rare complication.
   Objectives: The use of loop diuretics like furosemide is discussed in intensive care medicine regarding their clinical efficacy and safety. The hypothesis arose whether both parameters depend on the capability of serum albumin to transfer the drug to the kidneys. Methods: Serial blood & urine samples were taken from intensive care patients receiving furosemide infusions for volume overload. Free furosemide serum fractions & urine concentrations were determined by HPLC/LCMS. Albumin binding capacity (ABiC) was quantified by adding a binding site II (diazepam binding site) specific fluorescence marker (Dansylsarcosine, DS). The amount of unbound DS was detected by fluorescence analysis after ultrafiltration, corresponding with ABiC. Results: 62 patients were assessed. 50 patients (30male, 67,5 +/- 10,3 years) were included into statistical analysis. Main reasons for intensive care admission were sepsis (n=18) and perioperative care. Indications for furosemide were volume overload in acute or acute on chronic kidney injury (n=42), volume management in sepsis, ARDS or lung edema (n=8). ABiC was reduced to 65,2+/-12,2%, The free furosemide fraction (normal <5%) correlated negatively with ABiC (r -0,638, p<0,001) with 15,76+/-11,52% in those with ABIC<60% and 5,36+/-5,29% in ABiC 60% (p<0,001). The urinary fraction of furosemide (normal >65%) was significantly lower in those with ABiC <60% as compared to 60% (7,47+/-5,83% vs. 23,98+/-17,91, p<0,01). Furosemide induced increase in urine output was strongly correlated with ABiC (r=0,908, p<0,017). Discussion: Our results indicate a role of ABiC in the pharmacokinetics of furosemide, impacting its free serum fraction and urinary fraction. Data are suggestive for a link between status of the albumin-dependend drug carrier mechanism and the safety and efficacy of the drug. Clinicians will profit from our results regarding safe use of loop diuretics & furosemide responsiveness in patients with volume overload and kidney injury.
   Objectives: Albumin is a blood protein with various physiological functions as there are: maintenance of osmotic pressure, antioxidant and transport function for endogenous and exogenous ligands. Binding of these ligands can affect conformational changes of human serum albumin. Methods: The "Albumin-functionality-test" is based on EPR spectroscopy and detects modified binding and functional characteristics. The used radical supporting spin probe binds analogous ligands variably strong at different albumin binding sites and thus, serves as an indirect marker for serum albumin functionality with regard to its ability for binding, transport and detoxification. A comparison of three different mixtures of albumin and a spin-labeled fatty acid allows for the in vitro simulation of binding-, transport- and release-conditions by the Albumin-functionality-test. Thus, an "effective" albumin concentration could be determined. It quantifies the amount of functional albumin in the patient in comparison to healthy controls. Results: We applied Albumin-functionality-test to albumin preparations differing in redox state of cysteine-34, namely human mercaptalbumin (HMA), human non-mercaptalbumin1 (HNA1) and human non-mercaptalbumin2 (HNA2) and found differences in their functionality. The analysis of samples from patients with different states of liver failure showed a strong correlation of binding efficiency and detoxification efficiency, depending on the severity of the disease. Discussion: Due to the increasing numbers of studies using commercial albumin preparations for the treatment of patients with liver disease, we investigated different available albumin samples regarding their albumin functionality. We found dramatically reduced binding and detoxification efficiencies. Our findings might be used for patient selection and prognoses for personalized therapies. Taken together, these results might affect the importance of albumin from the patient view and refer to its stability as a drug.
   Objectives: The analysis of Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) power is a commonly used method to identify complications such as pump thrombosis. However, the LVAD power is also affected by different influences like the circadian rhythm. To optimize our thrombosis detection algorithm, we analyzed LVAD log files. Methods: For the investigation of power behavior in LVAD log files, we retrospectively analyzed 840 log files from 189 patients. Each patient received an HVAD (HeartWare). The log files contain on average 3000 power values collected over a period of appx. 31 days. None of the analyzed log files contained serious complications, such as a pump thrombosis. Results: To show a significant difference between the power values of the daytime (8 am-10 pm) and the night-time, a statistical test (significance level: 5%) was carried out. 813 of 840 log files showed a significant difference (average t = 16.94). In addition, the average difference between the maximum and the minimum power value of a day was calculated for each day (average: 1071.9mW, SD: 158.2mW, range: 497.1mW - 2299.5mW). Furthermore, the average power was calculated for each day and log file. To get a measure for the fluctuation in daily average of power development within a log file, the SD has been calculated (SD average: 65.3mW, range 10.4mW - 435.9mW). Discussion: The retrospective analysis of LVAD log files shows that power behavior is individual. Although most patients show a significant power difference between daytime and night-time hours, the maximum difference of a day and the average power changes over several days varies from patient to patient. A patient-specific power model, considering the circadian rhythm, was developed and applied to our thrombosis detection algorithms, which achieved a better thrombosis detection time of up to 93 hours compared to the LVAD controller alarming algorithm.
   Objectives: Suppression of membrane fouling is an important key technology for the development of portable and implantable artificial kidneys. Among several factors known to affect membrane fouling, we focused on the blood flow condition. In the present study, to clarify the effect of pulsatile and non-pulsatile blood flow on membrane fouling, an ex vivo hemofiltration experiment using porcine blood was carried out. Methods: Hemofiltration with filtrate recycling was performed under three conditions; pulsatile flow using a roller pump, non-pulsatile flow using a roller pump with three chambers to stabilize the flow, and non-pulsatile flow using a centrifugal pump. The blood flow rate (QB) was set at 50 or 100 mL/min and the maximum filtration rate at which irreversible membrane fouling would not occur was determined as follows; the first filtration rate (QF) was set at 2.5% of the QB for one hour (baseline), increased by 2.5% to 5% of the QB for one hour, and then returned to the baseline value for 20 min, and the transmembrane pressure (TMP) was measured to check if it had returned to the baseline value. This step was repeated until the QF reached 25% of the QB. Results: For both blood flow rates (50 and 100 mL/min), the maximum filtration flow rate at which the TMP did not return to the baseline, implying that irreversible membrane fouling had occurred, was higher under the non-pulsatile flow conditions than under the pulsatile flow condition. Discussion: The flow rate and the TMP changed periodically under the pulsatile flow condition and the peak TMP value was higher than that under the non-pulsatile flow condition, which increases the burden on the membrane. Thus, there is an increased likelihood of membrane fouling, as compared to the constant the pressure under the non-pulsatile flow condition.
   Objectives: The objective is to develop a simulator of the anatomy and hemodynamics of the radial artery in order to design a robust controller for a noninvasive, continuous blood pressure measurement method. Currently, blood pressure, in intensive care units, is measured invasively, which can lead to complications (e.g. infections). The novel approach facilitates a continuous noninvasive flow measurement, in addition to the instantaneous blood pressure measurement. Methods: During measurements, a controller pneumatically adjusts the pressure in a balloon, positioned on top of the radial artery, so that the Doppler derived flow in the radial artery is reduced to a constant target value. The resulting pressure in the balloon correlates with the blood pressure. For the development of this method, a simulator, modelling the anatomical conditions of the lower arm, was constructed. The simulator was designed to create arbitrary physiological pressure curves. For the validation of the simulator, invasively measured blood pressure curves and data found in literature related to the mass flow rates were compared to the curves created by the simulator. Results: The pressure curve, created with the simulator, shows a deviation of less than 5 % to the invasively measured blood pressure. The mass flow rate shows a good agreement with the literature data. The simulator is capable of simulating blood pressure curves with a mean arterial pressure of 40 mmHg to 120 mmHg. First tests with the controller have shown that it is possible to control the pulsatile flow to the constant target flow rate. Discussion: Regarding the simulator, the next step is to adjust it, so that it can simulate flows above a mean pressure of 120 mmHg. Regarding the controller, stress tests must be conducted. It must be evaluated whether it is robust enough to work with pressure curves that fluctuate in mean pressure and frequency.
   Objectives: Relative blood volume (RBV) changes during haemodialysis are typically estimated from variations in haematocrit, haemoglobin or total blood protein measured by optical, acoustic or other sensors integrated in the dialysis circuit. Due to dynamic changes in the circulation during the initial phase of dialysis (following filling of the extracorporeal circuit with the patient's blood and starting dialyzer ultrafiltration), the indications of RBV monitors depend on the exact moment of starting RBV measurements. The aim of this study was to assess this issue quantitatively using a mathematical modelling approach. Methods: The developed compartmental model describes the flow of blood across the cardiovascular system and the extracorporeal circuit combined with the whole-body transport of water and the most important osmotically active solutes and the baroreflex mechanisms. The model was validated using clinical data from patients on maintenance HD. A standard 4-hour HD session with 3 L ultrafiltration was studied for a virtual reference patient with all model parameters based on the literature data. RBV changes were derived from the simulated haematocrit (HCT) changes. Two cases were analysed: the priming saline being infused to the patient or discarded. Results: For the case when the priming saline was infused to the patient, the total RBV reduction at the end of the simulated dialysis session varied between 8 % (when HCT changes were monitored from the very beginning of dialysis) and 13 % (when HCT monitoring was started circa 4 minutes later). For the case when the priming saline was discarded, the analogous difference in RBV reduction was less than 1 percentage point. Discussion: When the priming saline is infused to the patient, a few minute difference in the moment of starting RBV measurements may significantly affect the indicated RBV changes, which is due to the dilution of blood by the infused saline and the time it takes for the uniform mixing of blood across the circulatory system.
   We have developed autologous in vivo tissue engineered vascular grafts (in vivo TEVG, i.e. BIOTUBE) mainly composed of fibroblasts and collagen constructed in the patients' subcutaneous tissues. After long term animal experiments over 5 years, we clinically applied them to the congenital heart surgery of a 2-year-old child as a pulmonary artery patch plasty material in 2015. Three years after implantation, 3D-CT exhibited neither aneurysmal dilatation, significant calcification, nor shrinkage of the patch graft interfering the growth of the pulmonary artery. The clinical course was good without any significant complications over 4 years presently. However, since the tissue formation largely depends on the regenerative ability of the host, individual differences exist, and it is an issue to secure the mechanical reliability of the grafts formed in high-risk patients. We are currently evaluating the changes in mechanical properties of TEVGs by chemical treatment, and are examining whether it is possible to improve mechanical durability. In addition, in order to fabricate the TEVGs in healthy individuals as allogeneic (parents) or xenogeneic tissue substitutes, we are conducting transplantation experiments on decellularized tissues. The in vivo TEVGs could also be applied to AV-shunts. However, in the animal pilot experiments, significant stenosis was observed at the anastomosis with host vein resulting in early occlusion probably because of high sheer stresses. The attempts to overcome the problems by several investigators are also reviewed.
   Objectives: To evaluate different designs or insertion techniques of cochlear implant electrode carriers (ECs) insertion forces are measured by a force sensor, which is mounted directly underneath an artificial cochlea model (aCM) leading to a summed force profile. One of the next steps in CI research leads from post-experimental evaluation of measured insertion force profiles to pre-experimental predictions of these profiles using analytical models based on an improved knowledge about factors impacting the insertion forces. Three likely factors were chosen for further investigation: speed, EC stiffness and curvature of the aCM. Methods: Three aCM were fabricated out of PTFE blocks, each model having one constant curvature (r = 6.4 / 8.5 / 12.7 mm). Additionally EC substitutes were fabricated using a two-component silicone, all with a constant diameter (0.7 mm), a total length of 20.5 mm and embedded bare copper wires. In order to vary the stiffness of the EC substitutes, one type had four and the other six wires embedded. They were inserted into the aCM with three different insertion speeds ( v = 0.11 / 0.4 / 1.6 mm/s). In order to increase reproducibility, insertions were conducted using an automated insertion test bench, comprising a linear actuator to clamp the EC substitutes and move them into the aCM and the force sensor underneath the model. Results: In accordance with theoretical considerations all varied factors showed effects on the insertion force profiles. Increased insertion speed and sample stiffness increased the insertion forces, whereas an increased model radius decreased the insertion forces. Discussion: The variance of measured forces within one set of parameters is due to the manual fabrication of samples and may be decreased by usage of commercial ECs. The influence of lubricants has to be analysed within future experiments.
   Objectives: The purpose of this work is to design and create a high efficiency inductive powering unit (IPU) for a wide range of implantable devices and artificial organs (AO). Methods: A possible way to realize wireless powering is to use inductive energy transfer systems. To maximize overall system efficiency class E power amplifier is widely used due to its 100% efficiency in the ideal case. But maximum efficiency can be achieved only if input and output system parameters will remain constant during IPU operation. Inductive coils have nonzero distance between them because of patient's tissue thickness. It is worth noting that tissue thickness is different for every patient: the difference may be several millimeters. Moreover, this value can change during IPU operation as a result of patient's motor activity or tissue edema which will lead to PA detuning and decreasing efficiency. To avoid PA's detuning, frequency tuning systems can be used. There are two approaches for tuning systems that can be found in the literature. The first uses voltage and/or current levels of important circuit nodes to estimate system status. This method is good and quite simple, but requires external control signals that means additional power losses and decreased efficiency. The other method uses the phase of the voltage signals from important nodes and consumes less power. The second method was chosen by authors to design a tuning system. Results: During this work, a calculation method for PA and the frequency tuning system were designed. The experimental prototype was created. The authors of this article obtained an overall system efficiency of more than 60 % for three different coil sets and output power from 0.7 W to 1 W for same coil sets and range of axial misalignments from 10 to 20 mm. Discussion: The high efficiency inductive powering system for AO has been designed and tested during this work.
   Objectives: Native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis (HD), but it still fails in more than 40% cases within the first year. Stenosis is the main cause of AVF failure, but its detection and prediction are still open clinical challenges. The purpose of our study was to explore the potential of using sound analysis to reveal unique characteristics in AVF sounds and to detect potentially relevant changes over time. Methods: We acquired the sounds of 10 AVFs, 7 referred by the nephrologists as well-functioning and 3 as stenotic AVFs. We also acquired the sound of 1 AVF characterized by severe stenosis and we repeated the recording after surgical revision. Sounds were recorded using the Littmann Electronic Stethoscope 3200 using wide mode. Sounds were transmitted via Bluetooth to a laptop and frequency spectra were obtained using an in-house Matlab code embedding the Fast Fourier Transform and a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 50 Hz, aimed at attenuating stethoscope's noise and heart sounds' frequencies. Results: In well-functioning AVFs we consistently found a low-frequency peak, located in the bandwidth 100-200 Hz, while no relevant spectral features were present at higher frequencies. On the other hand, stenotic AVFs showed high-frequency peaks, located in the bandwidth of 500-600 Hz. In the AVF with severe stenosis we found high-frequency peaks in the bandwidth 700-750 Hz, which were replaced by low-frequency peaks after AVF revision. Discussion: Sound analysis revealed unique characteristics in the frequency spectra of AVFs, allowing an objective discrimination between well-functioning and stenotic AVFs. This technique may bring the advantage of limiting clinician's skill-dependency and personal interpretation. Despite being preliminary, our results suggest that sound analysis may be used to detect stenosis development and allow patients' self-monitoring, resulting in early prediction of AVF failure.
   Objectives: Biofilms on percutaneous leads of implanted blood pumps can cause severe infections. By treating infections with antibiotics over a long period of time, bacteria develop resistance. Today, in a clinical setting, antibiotic resistance is determined in-vitro for all available drugs. The aim of the EvolChip project is to predict the probabilities of resistances that might evolve and suggest combinations of antibiotics that slow down or even prevent future resistance. Methods: The EvolChip reactor consists of an agar plate that serves as a diffusion and growth medium. Three membranes permit diffusion of active substances from microfluidic channels into the agar medium. Two of these channels serve as sources for different antibiotics, the third one as the sink. As a result, two overlapping drug gradients establish, with a low concentration near the sink and high concentration close to the sources. Antibiotics were mixed with a nutrient solution to promote bacteria migration towards higher concentrated areas. The bacteria contain a green fluorescent protein gene, which enables real-time tracking via polarisation filters and a camera. Results: In preliminary experiments, the gradient course could be characterized by making use of fluorescent markers. Only resistant bacteria migrated towards the sources with high antibiotic concentration. The spatial distribution of bacteria facilitates the identification of optimal concentration ratios and mixtures of antibiotics. In addition, the speed of resistance evolution with respect to different antibiotic mixtures was determined. Discussion: The proposed EvolChip concept showed promising results in preliminary experiments. Further geometries, growth media, and bacteria will be tested. In order to validate the method, patient strains with known treatment and resistance history will be compared to the predictions of the presented method.
   Objectives: Due to the growing demand for organs in liver transplantation, techniques for optimization of suboptimal livers are needed such as normotermic liver perfusion (PNT). In this way, hepatic repercussion of ischaemic preconditioning (PI) still remains unclear. This study aims to analyze the haemodynamic and biochemical alterations produced after intraoperative PI on livers subjected to 6 hours of PNT. As a secondary objective, we aim to determine the effect of PI on liver function. Methods: Eight minipig livers, randomized to control (n=4) and PI group (n=4), were perfused during six hours in a PNT circuit (34oC). The PI group was subjected to 10 minutes of ischaemia by means of a Pringle manoeuvrein the hepatic hilum, followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion. Biochemical and gasometric parameters were measured at baseline and hourly in perfusate. Pressures and flows in hepatic artery (HA) and portal vein (PV) were registered. For statistical analysis Spearman's rho test and Mann-Whitney U test was performed, considering p < 0,05 as significant. Results: There were significant differences in HA flow, adjusted to weight, doubling the control group (PI 0,42 +/- 0,17 ml/min/g Vs GC 0,17 +/- 0,05 ml/min/g; p=0,000); no differences were found in PV flow. Total proteins (PI 1,9 [1,7-2]g/dL Vs GC 1,3 [0,95-1,5]g/dL; p=0,000) and O-2 consumption rate (PI 0,086 [0,055-0,113] ml/min/g Vs GC 0,040 [0,017-0,060]ml/min/g; p=0,000)were significantly increased in the PI group. There were no significant differences in AST, ALT, or GGT. Discussion: The PI, as a previous maneuver to PNT, increases hepatic artery flow and O2 consumption without altering citolytic parameters in liver. This may improve hepatic functionality as a previous step in transplantation. Further molecular and histological study should be made to clarify our finding in PI on PNT.

AB Endowed with distinctive natural ecosystems and abundant biodiversity, regional environmental governance in developing countries, especially the environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs), is facing the daunting task to ultimately divert their regional development mode towards sustainable fashion through governance transition. However, given their less-developed status in particular expressed by under-developed economies, unsound political regimes, low governance capacity, such task seemingly insurmountable. In order to approach the incompatibility between economic development and maintenance of the ecosystem services value, and understand the complex and interlocked nature of the regional institution system of ESAs in developing countries, an ecosystem services value-based adaptive governance model was introduced to identify the deficiencies and failures of existing regional environmental governance and establish innovative arenas and transition agendas for innovating and reframing regional institutions and modifying role of regional actor groups and governance mode in the process of decision making on environmental issues. Such approaches were conducted in a circular diverting process in order to facilitate the mode of regional development transforming towards sustainable development. For demonstration the process of application and effectiveness of this methodology, a case study was conducted in a typical ESAs-the Water Source Area of the Middle Route Project of the South-North Water Diversion Project in China. Through integrating the ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment into a wider framework of institutional change, the regional institution system innovation and reformation was directed by taking the ESV changes and pattern of its geo-distribution in the research area as indicators or clues. Compared with traditional proposals for administrative change, the methodology proposed in this study was not prescriptive or directive: Rather, an approach for influencing the direction and speed of transition through a series of steering and coordination mechanism. Therefore, this model is with the potential to be implemented by local communities in regions, especially ESAs in developing countries, to encounter with similar regional development challenges and complex, interlocking, and over-dated regional institutional system associated with environmental issues.

AB This study uses data from 1,024 coffee producing households to address two critical questions regarding the role of cooperatives in Rwanda's coffee sector: Does cooperative membership increase adoption of best practices and coffee productivity? and do cooperatives improve farm household welfare? Using a propensity score matching technique to account for selection bias, we find that cooperatives are a critical institution for building farmer capacity, promoting adoption of improved technologies and inputs, and increasing productivity. We discuss the role that cooperatives can play in increasing farmer welfare and reestablishing the coffee sector as a pillar of growth in the country.

AB This study examines the progress of the two major universities in the Caribbean country of Trinidad and Tobago towards the transition to entrepreneurial universities through incorporating the core components of designing and delivering entrepreneurship education programmes, establishing effective university-led business incubators and the building of university-industry-government collaboration. The theoretical construct of the Triple Helix interrelationships and the development stages framework provide the basis for analysing the progress of the universities towards achieving their development mission. The general conclusion is that progress towards building an effective university-centred entrepreneurial ecosystem has been relatively slow and needs to be accelerated through more proactive leadership and greater involvement of internal and external stakeholders.

AB Due to its ability to create and disseminate knowledge, the modern university is understood as a central agent in innovation systems and technology upgrading dynamics. The main objective of this article is to assess the evolution of universities' embeddedness within the innovation system of an emerging economy in terms of patenting activity and linkages to industry. The study is based on information relating to the twelve most eminent universities in Brazil for the years 1994, 2004 and 2014. These institutions are found responsible for a substantial share of Brazilian patents - with an upward trend over the years - and these institutions have demonstrated a progressive embeddedness to the national innovation system. Such behavior seems to have co evolved along with improvements in the national institutional environment, leading to expectations that academia can become strategic in shaping the catching-up conditions in Brazil for the coming years. However, deeper connections with both domestic and foreign agents and multinational corporations are needed in order to accelerate the pace of university contribution to value chains and technology upgrading.

AB The use of various forms of ICTs (information communication technology) such as mobile telephones can foster the socio-economic progression of developing countries. Contextually appropriate design and use are needed for ICTs to deliver value to various parties within the socio-economic spheres of developing countries who have different needs and wants compared to those of the developed world. There is however scant empirical evidence of how various stakeholders symbiotically interact and create value in developing countries where large multinationals have limited access and engagement. Drawing on the theoretical lens of co-creation of value our paper examines how technology upgrading is achieved in the context of the Bangladeshi mobile telephone industry. In doing so this paper suggests technology upgrading can be achieved even without some of the key prerequisites such as financial, institutional, infrastructural facilities cited in existing literature. The findings offer useful theoretical and policy implications by providing deeper understanding of the interactions and interrelationships of those who have involvement in the value creation for mobile telephony and contribute to the development of effective business models and technological innovations for these marketplaces.

TI Scaling modern technology or scaling exclusion? The socio-political

AB In this article we explore whether and how the dynamics of access shape the scaling of modern agricultural technologies. It is based on the experience of an agricultural research for development (AR4D) project called CASCAPE, which aims to validate and scale agricultural best practices for smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. The socio-political dynamics of external interventions are often taken for granted contextual factors in AR4D projects. By contrast, this article takes this context as the point of departure for its analysis. The aim of this in-depth case study is to unpack the concept of access as condition for scaling of agricultural technologies. We identify and analyse the mechanisms that determine access to the various components of a malt barley technology package which was introduced in two highland communities in southern Ethiopia (and later 'scaled' to a range of other communities). Our research approach is technographic, implying that we consider the technology to contain both material and social components. The findings suggest that social and clan-based exchange mechanisms (such as clan-based loyalty, reciprocity and vertical accountability) are often rendered invisible even though they are of critical importance in governing access to the material and social components of modern agricultural technologies. Ignoring this socio-political context in the malt barley interventions resulted in an unintended scaling effect in terms of widening the social and economic gap between a few better off farmers and a larger group of poor farmers. The paper thus provides evidence that the socio-political dynamics of access to technology can have an important influence on its wide spread application and may complicate efforts to scale the uptake of technology. Paying more attention to such processes would help to improve the effectiveness of AR4D efforts.

ID INDEXES
AB This study used primary data obtained from rice farmers in Guinea Savannah Zone (GSZ), Forest Savannah Transition Zone (FSTZ) and Coastal Savannah Zone (CSZ). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to classify farmers into technology adopters. The study used Welch's t-test to test the statistical significant differences in yield between technology adopters. Through the use of PCA, farmers were objectively classified as non-adopters (users of indigenous farming practices, IFPs), adopters of farmer innovation systems (FISs), adopters of improved agricultural technologies (IATs), and adopters of both FISs and IATs. Comparatively, a larger proportion of farmers in CSZ adopted IATs. The lowest percentage of farmers adopted IATs in GSZ. FISs' package is highly adopted by farmers in FSTZ. With the help of Welch t-test, the study demonstrated that adopters of FISs obtained appreciable rice productivity even though it is second to IATs. The study showed that IATs are the superior technologies when considering rice productivity and hence should be highly promoted among farmers in the whole country. Concerted and co-ordinated efforts should be made for researchers in national agricultural research and academic agricultural research institutions or centres to research into rice production and farmer innovation systems, improve upon them and make them available to farmers for adoption.

TI Does group farming empower rural women? Lessons from India's experiments

ID COLLECTIVE ACTION; MALE MIGRATION
AB Efforts by governments in developing countries to economically empower rural women rarely focus on farming, an occupation in which the majority have experience. Those that do are typically directed at women within family farms, rather than at creating group-based alternatives outside the familial domain. In this context, two state-level initiatives in India, launched in the early 2000s, stand out, for their innovative experiment in group farming. They encouraged women to collectively cultivate leased land and become farm managers in their own right. Based on the author's detailed quantitative and qualitative surveys in the states of Telangana and Kerala, this paper analyses whether farming in groups empowers women economically as well as socially and politically. Also, given the divergent implementation strategy of the two states, which approach is more effective and why? The lessons learnt can provide pointers for replication elsewhere.

AB China's phenomenal growth and unprecedented urbanization are accompanied by social and environment problems such as rising inequality and rural stagnation. However, a new form of development based on Alibaba Group's Taobao e-commerce platform, known as Taobao villages, has emerged in rural China to capitalize from e-commerce and sustain rural development. We investigate development trajectories and organizational structure of Taobao villages to better understand e-commerce and regional development in rural China, including the role of entrepreneurs, firms, and local states. We find that Taobao villages are being produced through economic restructuring and institutional change in response to shifting economic contexts. We have identified five development models of Taobao villages: production-oriented Xishan, Qiaoyun and Bainiu models, and market-oriented Beishan and Qingyanliu models. We also find that local states and ICT (information and communication technology) firms have played an important role in facilitating the development of Taobao villages. Taobao villages have to work closely with their local and external networks to upgrade technology, enhance innovation, and increase added value. Local contexts and spatial networking are essential to the development of Taobao villages. As a new form of regional development, Taobao villages may provide a pathway to economic development for rural areas in other developing countries.

AB An institutional repository (IR) is an information system (IS) that has the potential to promote open access to scientific knowledge and the visibility and reputation of scholars. The small number of universities in developing countries that have successfully innovated and implemented an IR hampers the actualization of these benefits. This situation calls for effort toward understanding the factors responsible. We used the snowball sampling technique to select 45 academic librarians from three university libraries in Nigeria that were involved in IR innovation. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and participatory observation for 15 months. Thematic data analyses show that the relationships between academic librarians' IR innovation cognitive frames (belief, scripts, and resistance routines) influence IR innovation outcomes. The result is a research model that explicates how the relationships between academic librarians' cognitive frames and internal functioning of libraries constitute IR innovation barriers to IR innovation and implementation.

AB Emerging economies are often characterized by pervasive institutional changes and resultant institutional voids. In the absence of strong formal institutions, firms rely on informal institutions to fill these voids. This article argues that the process of sensemaking for firms in turbulent environments is continuous and dependent on cyclical adjustments connecting performance via a feedback loop to scanning and interpretation. Far from being a one-time occurrence, environmental sensemaking is a process operating in accord with continuous environmental changes. This study's findings derive from an in-depth analysis of a Russian pharmaceutical firm and an Indian telecommunications firm, and demonstrate that entrepreneurs make sense and gain legitimacy through political connections. The study further finds that improvements in institutional environments reduce the salience of political networks, thereby creating a choice for firms to rely on formed market mechanisms or continue along the path of political connections that evolve to public-private partnerships.

ID INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS; GOVERNANCE
AB Under the new climate change regime ushered in by the 2015 Paris Agreement, technology development and transfer have emerged as essential means of global action for climate change mitigation and adaptation. In particular, technological innovation has appeared as a leading component to be accelerated, encouraged, and enabled under the Paris Agreement. However, while making the rule book to implement the Paris Agreement, a clash has occurred between developed and developing countries over the meaning of technological innovation and the intervening policies of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to support innovation in developing countries. By exploring rule-making processes and expert-meetings under the UNFCCC, this paper examines how this discursive contestation has progressed in relation to the meaning of technological innovation and the creation of an appropriate institutional design to support developing countries' achievement of technological innovation. The analysis is based on the theoretical framework of discursive contestation between the two discourses of de-regulatory ecological modernisation and green governmentality with right-to-development. This research concludes by positing some policy implications.

AB Development economists have considered physical infrastructure to be a precondition for industrialization and economic development. Infrastructure investments play a particularly important role in expanding overall employment opportunities either directly by absorbing workers or indirectly by crowding in private investments, technology adoption, and production activities through which new jobs are created. As investments in infrastructure increasingly address the integration of technology and sustainability principles, the nature of jobs and skill requirements are also changing. On one hand, augmented public funding can favor infrastructure investments that have higher employment elasticity to ensure adequate job creation. On the other hand, the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution calls for a more skill-intensive workforce. Using findings from existing studies on infrastructure and data from Asian Development Bank, this paper discusses changing infrastructure investments in a rapidly changing technological environment and how developing countries can reap employment creation benefits through innovations.

AB Purpose
   This paper aims to investigate the pattern of technological capability building in the gas turbine industry as a complex product system (CoPS) in an Iranian gas turbine producer named Oil Turbo Compressor Company (OTC) and to recognize multi-level (firm, industry and national) drivers influencing technological catching up in this company.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper used a qualitative approach and case study research strategy. A preliminary theoretical framework is proposed based on research background. Also, the data were collected from various sources, including the interview with 11 experts, studying many documents and participating in some relevant meetings and conventions. To analyze the data, the authors relied on their preliminary theoretical framework and applied the chronological sequence analysis technique.
   Findings
   Our findings show that, first, in contrast with mass-produced industries where capability building pattern often leads to product innovation, technological capabilities in OTC have evolved from assembling to manufacturing, upgrading and finally redesigning of existing models of gas turbines. Second, two firm-level (proper technology acquisition strategies and building organizational and managerial capabilities), two industry-level (networking, integration and collaboration among key actors and existence of local market and demand) and two national-level (government's policies, supports and initiatives and institutional arrangement and political conditions) drivers have played indispensable roles in facilitating and accelerating technological catching up by OTC.
   Research limitations/implications - Inevitably, the current research faces a few limitations. For instance, the difficulty of generalization is considered an inherent problem because it is a case study of only one Iranian latecomer company, as well as only one CoPS industry. Regarding implications, the findings suggest that technological catching up in CoPS industries in developing countries is not a simple and autonomous process and is influenced by multi-level factors, including national-, industry- and firm-level drivers.
   Originality/value
   In terms of theory, this paper tends to investigate and explain the catching-up process in OTC as an Iranian gas turbine producer by applying a multi-level theoretical framework that consists of firm-, industry- and national-level drivers. In terms of practice, this paper aims at investigating drivers affecting the catching-up process in a CoPS industry in a developing country that was faced with vast international sanctions, while many other studies in this area examined cases from developing countries such as Korea and China that had the opportunity of enjoying international collaborations and overseas knowledge flows.

AB International agreements and institutions affect innovation in developing countries. We analyze the impact of advanced country multinational enterprises (AMNEs) and supranational organizations on the regulatory adoption of global intellectual property protection standards. In particular, we investigate 60 developing countries that signed the Trade-relate Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement of the World Trade Organization in 1994. Our empirical findings show that a greater involvement of AMNEs in the domestic innovation systems of developing countries results in more stringent TRIPS adoption and convergence to advanced country IP protection standards. This relationship is positively moderated by country dependency on supranational organizations such as the International Monetary Fund. This analysis contributes to the literature on institutional change and institutional voids. It provides insights into the influence of external actors on the underlying change processes.

AB This study deals with the problem of human resources planning due to the additional workforce requirements of research activities. In practice, planning of human resource expansion is seldom done in a systematic manner, thus leading to sub-optimal results. In this work, a P-graph model is developed as a decision support tool to aid in planning expansion of staffing levels for Higher Education Institutions. Many higher education institutions in the developing world are undergoing the transition from being teaching-intensive to becoming increasingly research-oriented. This shift is widely recognized as an important adjustment to the need for universities to play a greater role in creating knowledge capital, which is an essential component to fuel the next phase of growth of developing countries. Research universities are an essential resource for facilitating eco-innovation in industry. New targets that involve increased research output tend to put strain on institutional processes and resources that were previously configured to meet the demands of teaching-intensive organizations. The model formulation is based on an input-output framework that reflects interdependencies among different employee categories. The use of the model is illustrated with a representative case study of a typical Higher Education Institution in the Philippines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multinational enterprises (MNEs) have increasingly entered markets in less developed regions of the world afflicted with weak institutions and political conflict. Some are characterised by extreme' cases of institutional voids and terrorism, creating a hostile environment for the organisation and its people. This in-depth qualitative study of a service company, a European telecommunications joint venture in Afghanistan, seeks to shed light and build theory on the human resource management (HRM) dimension of managerial learning and knowledge acquisition in hostile environments, as part of the MNE's organisational learning process. Specifically, we investigate how knowledge gaps can be addressed through supportive HR practices, and how knowledge classified as rare' can be captured and leveraged through HR interventions such as debriefing. We stipulate that HR practices and interventions adapted to hostile environments, together with expatriate willingness to learn and share new knowledge, play a critical role in the creation, capturing and leveraging of rare knowledge for subsequent use by the MNE in other hostile locations. The study has implications for international HRM and organisational resilience, under the proposition that competitive advantage can be gained through exploitation of rare knowledge acquired in hostile environments.

AB In the messy world of global governance, the principle of subsidiarity has the potential to order relations between different layers of governance as well as compensate for the legitimacy deficit of global governance institutions. However, subsidiarity has received surprisingly little scholarly attention in the discipline of International Relations. This article therefore seeks to examine the promises and perils of subsidiarity in global governance by adducing empirical evidence from Africa, a region which has authored norms and policies that often contest global norms and institutions. Based on two case studies of pro-democratic intervention in The Gambia and court proliferation at the (sub-)regional levels, the article concludes that while subsidiarity may strengthen democracy and the rule of law at the national level, it may also undermine the rule of law at the global level, as well as dilute fundamental global norms that serve to protect basic human rights. At the same time, subsidiarity provides opportunities for normative innovation, which suggests that more attention needs to be paid to the law-generating effects of subsidiarity and to the Global South as an agent of change in international law and global governance.

AB What organisational attributes enhance a military's ability to effectively adapt on the battlefield? Upon the outbreak of war in July 2014 between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) encountered an expansive network of tunnels from which Hamas was launching large-scale assaults into Israel. This article illustrates that the IDF's ability to successfully adapt 'under fire' to this battlefield surprise was facilitated by several important attributes related to its organisational learning capacity: a dynamic, action-oriented organisational culture, a flexible leadership and command style, specialised commando units which acted as 'incubators' for learning and innovation, and a formal system to institutionalise and disseminate lessons learned.

AB Purpose This paper aims to investigate whether a complementary effect exists between government R&D subsidies (GRSs) and intellectual property rights (IPR) protection on innovation performance in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China. This paper also attempts to understand whether this complementary effect is significantly different across China's eastern, central and western regions. Design/methodology/approach The study sample comprised 28 provinces involved in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in China from 2003 to 2014. Ordinary least squares was used to test the complementary effects of GRSs and IPR protection on innovation performance. The seemingly unrelated estimation test was also applied to ascertain whether differences existed between the eastern and western regions. Findings A complementary effect between GRSs and IPR protection in terms of improving the innovation of pharmaceutical manufacturers was found to exist only in eastern and western regions. There was no significant difference in the complementary effect between GRSs and IPR protection in terms of improving innovation among the three regions. Without considering the interaction effect of GRSs and IPR protection, the GRSs were negatively associated with innovation in the eastern region, but positively related to the innovation in central region. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on government policies and innovation by incorporating the interaction effect of GRSs and IPR protection on innovation in the context of a high-tech industry (pharmaceutical manufacturing) in an emerging economy (China). It also explores the internal differences in the influence of this complementary effect on innovation in an emerging economy, enriching the institution-based view.

AB The study aimed to examine the barriers to embracing enzymatic processing in the garment industry in a developing country. We used the case of Bangladesh, which has the largest garment sector in the world. The research used semistructured interviews with 10 high-profile figures in the industry, comprising scientists, manufacturers, enzyme traders, and policymakers. We found economic, sociocultural, informational, and policy-related barriers to the adoption of enzymatic processing. Attending to each element would benefit manufacturers primarily; this will help identify its strengths and weaknesses to ensure the effective implementation of enzymatic textile processing to obtain optimum results. The study also found that manufacturers' desire to help improve environmental performance is a factor, which could motivate them in adopting green manufacturing innovation. It is expected that regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation-particularly from high social responsiveness and compliances as well as economic and financial incentives-would motivate manufacturers to develop sustainable environmental management strategies that enhance their ability to compete in global markets.

AB The subject of financial system development is widely studied in the finance literature as an indicator of economic growth and a driver of technological innovation supporting the mobilization of capital for growth. However, varying results are obtained when examining developed countries compared to the emerging countries. Developing countries are characterized by a lower investment in innovation, and lower levels of competitiveness in terms of research and development funding, fewer research academic institutions, but also lower incentives for private innovation by enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial development indicators and innovation by analyzing data for 15 developing countries within the time frame of 1996-2016. The financial system is analyzed in two main pillars: credit institutions and equity markets. The number of innovation patent applications is the dependent variable of the study, i.e. as an indicator of a country's innovative performance. The results of the study show that a higher level of crediting by the banking sector will positively affect the number of patent applications. Credit mobilization by other financial intermediaries in the financial system such as equity markets or non-banking institutions show a lower efficiency in boosting innovation activities, resulting in the opposite effects regarding the number of patent applications. Countries with a higher level of education will show more efforts toward innovation and the development of innovative practices. On the other hand, higher competitiveness among companies in terms of technology innovation and processes is expected to boost the demand for funds in the financial system, leading to the improvement in system development.

AB Objectives Uptake of maternal health services remains suboptimal in Ethiopia. Significant proportions of antenatal care attendees give birth at home. This study was conducted to identify the predictors of non-institutional delivery among women who received antenatal care in the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region, Ethiopia.
   Design A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among women who delivered in the year preceding the survey and who had at least one antenatal visit. Multistage cluster sampling was deployed to select 2390 women from all administrative zones of the region. A mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the predictors of non-institutional delivery; adjusted ORs (AOR) with 95% CIs are reported.
   Results The proportion of non-institutional deliveries among participants was 62.2% (95% CI 60.2% to 64.2%). Previous experience of short and simple labour (46.9%) and uncomplicated home birth (42.9%), night-time labour (29.7%), absence of pregnancy-related problem (18.8%) and perceived providers poor reception of women (17.8%) were the main reasons to have non-institutional delivery. Attending secondary school and above (AOR=0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85), being a government employee (AOR=0.27; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.78) and woman's autonomy in healthcare utilisation decision making (AOR=0.51; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.79) were among the independent predictors negatively associated with non-institutional delivery. On the other hand, unplanned pregnancy (AOR=1.67; 95% CI 1.16 to 2.42), not experiencing any health problem during pregnancy (AOR=8.1; 95% CI 3.12 to 24.62), not perceiving the risks associated with home delivery (AOR=6.64; 95% CI 4.35 to 10.14) were the independent predictors positively associated with non-institutional delivery.
   Conclusions There is a missed opportunity among women attending antenatal care in southern Ethiopia. Further health system innovations that help to bridge the gap between antenatal care attendance and institutional delivery are highly recommended.

AB The agricultural research and development institutions in most developing countries are poorly equipped to support the needs of millions of smallholder farmers that depend upon them. The research approaches taken by these systems explicitly or implicitly seek simple, one-size-fits-all solutions for problems and opportunities that are extremely diverse. Radical change is needed to facilitate the agroecological intensification of smallholder farming. We propose that large-scale participatory approaches, combined with innovations in information and communications technology (ICT), could enable the effective matching of diverse options to the wide spectrum of socio-ecological context that characterize smallholder agriculture. We consider the requirements, precedents and issues that might be involved in the development of farmer research networks (FRNs). Substantial institutional innovation will be needed to support FRNs, with shifts in roles and relationships amongst researchers, extension providers and farmers. Where farmers' organizations have social capital and strong facilitation skills, such alignments may be most feasible. Novel information management capabilities will be required to introduce options and principles, enable characterization of contexts, manage data related to option-by-context interactions and enable farmers to visualize their findings in useful and intelligible ways. FRNs could lead to vastly greater capacity for technical innovation, which could in turn enable greater productivity and resilience, and enhance the quality of rural life.

AB We live in a world of climate injustice. People in wealthy countries emit large amounts of greenhouse gasses, whose effects will be particularly adverse to people in poor countries who have not received the benefits of past emissions. Although these injustices are deeply embedded in power asymmetries, they could be ameliorated if wealthy societies were to take broad views of their own self-interests. To do so would require, in some instances, changes in the default rules, embedded in sovereignty, that have inhibited positive changes. To ensure that such positive changes ensue will require new and well-designed institutions, two of which are proposed. An Institute for Climate Finance would facilitate offset arrangements by which rich countries pay for emissions reductions in poorer countries. An Institute for Climate Innovation would facilitate the transfer of innovative low- or zero-emission energy technology to developing countries.

AB Mobile money innovations are expanding rapidly in developing countries, where they appear to be on track to extend financial services to billions of unbanked populations. However, adoption rates differ significantly across countries, and the success of innovations is also radically different within countries. To understand the factors that affect the development and diffusion of mobile money services, this study uses a mixed research method that combines cross-country data of adoption rates and an in-depth case study of a successful mobile money innovation. Quantitative analysis of adoption rates across countries indicates the varying role of institutional and economic factors on the adoption and usage of mobile money innovations. We undertake an in-depth study of M-Pesa in Kenya, one of the world's most known mobile money innovations, to gain nuanced understanding of the development and diffusion of the innovation. Analysis using the functional innovation system approach reveals the key role of the lead firm in guiding the innovation process, and the importance of a supportive regulatory environment that sought to advance financial inclusion. The results further reveal how the power and interest dynamics of key actors in the innovation system can shape the emergence of inclusive innovations that aim to address social issues.

AB Using data for a sample of 35 sub-Saharan African economies for 1995-2015, this study examines the extent to which political institutions identified as belonging to democratic or autocratic regimes explains the existing differences in innovation across sub-Saharan Africa. While the very few existing studies focus only on the direct effect of institutions, this article examines the impact of the interaction between different regime types and human capital development on innovation in developing countries. The evidence provides very strong support for the direct effect of democratic development on innovation as well as for its indirect effect via its impact on human capital development. However, the results do not support theories that argue in favour of interaction between democracy and human capital, thereby pointing to the need for better calibration of the numerous existing theories and related empirical measures.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of access to skilled labor in explaining firms' sales growth subject to the controlling influence of a wide range of firm-specific characteristics and country-level economic and non-economic factors. Design/methodology/approach The analysis uses a consistent and large firm-level data set from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys that includes 138 developing countries. An instrumental variables model with a GMM estimator is used for estimating the impact of access to skilled labor on firm performance. In order to obtain more robust estimators, the analysis introduces country-level controls reflecting the influence of economic and institutional factors, such as economic and financial development, institutional governance, education and technological progress. Findings The results document a significant and positive association between access to skilled labor and firm performance in the developing world. The explanatory power of access to skilled labor remains broadly robust after controlling for a wide range of firm-specific characteristics: sectoral and geographical influences matter. The results also show that the association between labor skill constraints and firm performance is mitigated by country-level factors but in diverse ways. Development, institutions, education and technological progress exert various mitigating effects on firm-level behavior regarding access to skilled labor. Originality/value The paper's novel contribution is threefold: first, it uses joint firm, sector and country-level information to analyze the role of access to skilled labor on firm performance; second, it uses consistently produced information at the firm level from 138 developing countries; and, third, it considers the controlling impact of a wide range of country-level factors that reflect a country's overall development, institutions and evolution.

TI Perceptions of drones, digital adherence monitoring technologies and
   educational videos for tuberculosis control in remote Madagascar: a
   mixed-method study protocol
SO BMJ OPEN
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction Poor road and communication infrastructure pose major challenges to tuberculosis (TB) control in many regions of the world. TB surveillance and patient support often fall to community health workers (CHWs) who may lack the time or knowledge needed for this work. To meet the End TB Strategy goal of reducing TB incidence by 90% by 2035, the WHO calls for intensified research and innovation including the rapid uptake of new tools, interventions and strategies. Technologies that 'leapfrog' infrastructure challenges and support CHWs in TB control responsibilities have the potential to dramatically change TB outcomes in remote regions. Such technologies may strengthen TB control activities within challenged national tuberculosis treatment and control programmes (NTPs), and be adapted to address other public health challenges. The deployment of innovative technologies needs to be differentially adapted to context-specific factors. The Drone Observed Therapy System (DrOTS) project was launched in Madagascar in 2017 and integrates a bundle of innovative technologies including drones, digital adherence monitoring technology and mobile device-based educational videos to support TB control.
   Methods and analysis This mixed-methods study gathers and analyses cultural perceptions of the DrOTS project among key stakeholders: patients, community members, CHWs, village chiefs and NTP-DrOTS mobile health teams. Data from questionnaires, semistructured interviews, focus group discussions (FGD) and ethnographic observation gathered from June 2018 to June 2019 are thematically analysed and compared to identify patterns and singularities in how DrOTS stakeholders perceive and interact with DrOTS technologies, its enrolment processes, objectives and team.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the National Bioethics Research Committee of Madagascar and Stony Brook University institutional review board. Study results will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication. In Madagascar, results will be presented in person to Ministry and other Malagasy decision-makers through the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar.
   Patient and public involvement This study is designed to foreground the voices of patients and potential patients in the DrOTS programme. CHW participants in this study also supported the design of study information sessions and recruitment strategies. One member of the mobile health team provided detailed input on the wording and content of FGD and interview guides. Study findings will be presented via a report in French and Malagasy to CHW, mobile health team and other village-level participants who have email/internet access.

AB The failure of the majority of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia to take advantage of agricultural technologies and economic opportunities in the livestock sector remains an unresolved puzzle. This paper assesses the role of economic, social, political and organizational processes on technology adoption in smallholder livestock production systems based on innovation systems perspective. Functions of the innovation systems framework was used to assess the missing links in the dairy sector value chains. The results show that weak or missing innovation systems functions such as entrepreneurship, knowledge diffusion, market development, and policy advocacy mirror the low uptake of improved technologies in the livestock sector. Shortage of domestic suppliers of key technological inputs and services, weak input and output markets and weak interaction among value chain actors have been the major hindrances to livestock development. For example, there were no reliable sources of improved breeds of dairy heifers, veterinary supplies, quality semen, and equipment. The results suggest that technical knowledge and availability of economic opportunities alone may not be enough to stimulate the uptake of technologies and commercialization of dairy production. The peculiar nature of inputs, services, and output in the livestock sector requires innovative business models that can facilitate the coordination of knowledge, skills, inputs, services and output markets in livestock value chains.

AB The delivery of appropriate technology to rural communities poses multi-dimensional challenges, such as the lack of acceptance, complexities in implementation, and sustainability. The solution to this problem requires a structured approach and institutionalised intervention. In recent years, the top-down approach of rural development practiced creation/enablement of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises through technological interventions. But there has been no technology transfer framework available for rural organisations, especially in the context of developing nations. Thus, the aim of this article is to propose a holistic technology transfer mechanism with necessary understanding of the problems and mitigation of relevant hurdles. A case of a collaborative technology development mechanism called the Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG), has been discussed using a qualitative case study approach. This new rural technology transfer mechanism was found to be effective for upgrading traditional tools/technologies in practice among rural artisans, weavers, and farmers. To showcase the participatory technology development and dissemination strategy, a case of redesigning a Pirn winding machine is presented. The new Pirn winding machine can produce 12 Pirns at a time instead of 1 Pirn, as in the traditional process. This paper highlights some of the key aspects of technology development, assessment, transfer, and hand-holding, which is befitting for resource-constrained areas.

AB We examine how access to imported intermediate inputs affects firm-level product innovation in five developing counties. We combine trade data with survey data on innovation and develop a method to determine whether new inputs were essential for the product innovation. We find evidence that the number of newly imported varieties has a significant impact on product innovations that rely on new inputs and provide suggestive evidence that this effect comes from access to better quality imports. We extend our analysis to assess the consequences of the increase in the number of Chinese exporting firms on product innovation in developing countries.

AB This study analyzed a rural renewable energy project the Esaghem Village solar photovoltaic-based electrification project in Manyu Division, Cameroon. The aim was to unveil impediments to the project rooted in the country's institutional framework for energy policy administration. The framework adheres to the country's Weberian-style administrative machinery. Conspicuous features of the machinery, including its pyramidal structure, tendency for top-down hierarchical communication, aversion for interorganizational interaction, and standardization are shown to constitute major institutional impediments. These features caused problems such as a lack of information, skills, and innovation. They also exacerbated problems relating to custom formalities and stand to threaten project sustainability. Administrative reform actions including the promotion of inter-organizational coordination, administration decentralization reinforced with the creation of renewable energy extension programs, and market-oriented liberalization measures are recommended. These reforms promise to facilitate the diffusion of solar PV electrification and other renewable energy technologies in Cameroon and other developing countries.

AB The global debate on food security and the kinds of farming systems that could prove economically and ecologically sustainable has focused overwhelmingly on small family farms versus large commercial farms, with little attention being given to alternative models based on farmer cooperation. France offers a significant but under-researched and internationally little-recognized model of group farming - the GAEC (Groupement Agricole d'Exploitation en Commun) - based on farmers pooling land, labour and capital. This model is of considerable contemporary interest for both France and other countries. Catalysed by a 1962 law, GAECs accounted for 7.6% of farms and 15% of agricultural adult work units in 2010, but their incidence varied greatly across regions. Using data from the French agricultural census and other sources, this paper identifies the factors - economic, ecological, social and demographic - underlying this regionally uneven development of GAECs (and comparatively of EARLs - Exploitations Agricoles a Responsabilite Limitee - another type of group farm introduced in 1985). Regions with a higher incidence of group farms are found to be those that were historically dominated by middle-sized farms, had a local ecology favouring labour-intensive animal breeding, especially pastures, a higher proportion of agricultural graduates, greater economic equality and social institutions that promote community cohesion, among other factors. These results illuminate not only the conditions favourable to the emergence of group farming in France, but also the conditions under which such farmer cooperation could take root in other (including developing) countries, subject to context-specific modifications of the French model.

ID DISCOURSES
AB The Paris Agreement heralds a new era in international climate governance. Yet, the Agreement's implementation rulebook is still under negotiation. During this transition, from the Kyoto Protocol to the new regime under the Paris Agreement, many non-state actors are facing a high level of uncertainty. In particular, actors in the voluntary carbon market are struggling to define their new role. The business model of producing carbon credits in developing countries and selling them elsewhere is threatened. Although its financial significance and achieved emission reductions are limited, the voluntary market's role as an incubator for innovation has made it a prominent representative of non-state mitigation mechanisms. Therefore, we ask: What effects will the regime change to the Paris Agreement have on the voluntary carbon offset market (VCM) and how does it react to these effects?This study analyses perceptions of, and reactions to, the new regulatory environment within the VCM. We apply the Discursive Agency Approach to scrutinize the institutions, discourses and influential agents involved in the VCM, and the strategic practices they apply to manage the transition towards the Paris regime. We find two dominant coping strategies: to align the voluntary offsetting mechanism with the Paris Agreement, and to re-invent its overall purpose as a tool to deliver sustainable development rather than solely emission reductions. Based on these results, we outline thought spaces' for a future VCM: (1) voluntary and non-party offsetting beyond nationally determined contributions (NDCs), (2) results-based financing for emission reductions and sustainable development, and (3) private climate action under international oversight.Key policy insights The Paris Agreement threatens the VCM's business model, prompting market agents to frame and legitimize their work in new ways.The voluntary market's viability depends on the future accounting rules for emission reductions under Paris Agreement Article 6.Discursive struggles surround the risks of double counting and NDC ambitions.Based on an understanding of the past, we can draw lessons from agents' attempts to re-legitimize their role under the new Paris Agreement; their future visions will shape the debates about this nascent regime.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and strategic renewal (as a critical dimension of corporate entrepreneurship) might transmit government institutional support and thereby enhance firm performance in a transition economy. Design/methodology/approach Multi-respondent data were collected from 230 Chinese-based firms. The hypotheses were tested with structural equation modeling, in combination with a bias-corrected bootstrap method, to assess the significance of the theorized direct and indirect relationships. Findings Government institutional support enhances EO and strategic renewal individually, yet EO also fully mediates the relationship between government institutional support and strategic renewal. Moreover, strategic renewal fully mediates the relationship between EO and firm financial performance, and it partially mediates the relationship between EO and firm reputation. Originality/value This study contributes to entrepreneurship literature by testing an organization-level model of entrepreneurial phenomena in established firms that identifies EO and strategic renewal as two distinct mechanisms through which government institutional support in a transition economy can enhance organizational effectiveness, which entails the firm's financial performance and reputation. In doing so, this study provides an extended understanding of how EO and strategic renewal might influence a firm's financial and nonfinancial outcomes in different ways.

AB Technology innovation is a key to Off-Site Construction (OSC), but it can achieve economic and social benefits through diffusion. Previous research mainly focused on the optimization or on-site applications of OSC technology innovation; little on its diffusion-related analysis. Diffusion performance generally leads to a faster and deeper diffusion of OSC technology innovation. To study what influence the diffusion performance of OSC technology innovation, the authors first determined the research border and proposed four hypotheses, and then conducted a questionnaire in various China's construction companies. After investigating 119 construction companies for three months, 151 valid responses were collected and analyzed using Hierarchical Regression and bootstrap-based mediation test approaches. The results found that both market and government had significant impacts on the diffusion performance with comparable influence degree (0.282** and 0.255**), the government played a dual-mediating effect with network power simultaneously (effect value is 0.215) and the technical versatility had a significant indirect influence (>0.204**) but weak direct impact (0.094) on the diffusion performance of OSC technology innovation. The conclusions explored the influence mechanism of different factors on the diffusion of OSC technology innovation and provided practical suggestions for both construction companies and government authorities to promote the development of OSC.

AB The analysis of rents and rent-seeking is highly relevant for evolutionary economics but it has received little attention. This paper surveys the recent literature on technological change, rents, and rent-seeking applied to economic development. Economic development requires developing countries to upgrade technologically while coping with pervasive rent-seeking activities. We assess these issues in turn. This paper first surveys the literature on technical learning and institutional change due to the adoption and adaptation of new technology. Next, the debate on rents and rent-seeking, especially in relation to the issue of technological change in the process of development, is presented. Finally, we assess the roles of the state in solving the critical constraints faced by firms and industries. This paper asserts that the processes of development and industrial upgrading require understanding the mechanisms of rent managementa configuration of incentives and pressures that fully correspond to the existing political, institutional, and industrial structures of a developing country. The rent management analysis emphasizes the diversity of empirical contexts across and within countries.

   Public-private-dialogue; Cronyism; Institutions

AB This paper is trying to investigate whether formal state-business consultations (or simply public private dialoguesPPD) and/or cronyism could counteract low institutional capacities and provide the needed mechanisms for fostering innovation. It is doing this with the help of a theoretical discussion highlighting the links between National Innovation System, state business relations (SBR) and good governance institutions. This is then followed by an empirical study based on this discussion and using various OLS multivariate panel regressions. Evidence is found that the presence of business associations that are widely participated help in promoting innovation. They do this also in countries suffering from low institutional settings, and correct for the shortcomings caused by low regulatory quality. PPD play also an important role in counteracting institutional deficiencies that could otherwise harm innovation; and this is specifically the case for low government effectiveness. High official representation in PPD is a key for such needed outcome. PPD, however, need an open climate where the government is accountable to various societal groups and where different interest groups are free to aggregate their power. On the other hand, favoritism in allocation of resources and Cronyism might counteract institutional deficiencies, especially with regard to low government effectiveness and low regulatory quality. Yet, the overall effect of cronyism on innovation is still negative. Tackling the reduction of cronyism as an objective presents PPD as an alternative that could counteract low government effectiveness and high participation in business associations as another alternative which manages to counteract low regulatory quality, provided that cronyism is minimized in both cases. The novelty of this study rests on the contribution it aims at providing in an area where research is insufficient. There is lack of research on how innovation is affected generally by SBR, and more specifically by either formal or informal forms of SBR and cronyism. Empirical studies are even scarcer in this regard.

AB The role of (entrepreneurial) universities as change agents in regional economic development has been highlighted previously, but how they can drive regional sustainable development in developing countries has been largely neglected to date. Using qualitative methods and building upon institutional perspectives of sustainable change, we show how being confronted with adverse poverty and pollution in local contexts can drive an entrepreneurial university to develop a sustainability vision that accordingly becomes the driver of institutional change. We demonstrate how local campus leadership, a holistic teaching and research programme, and student involvement can have significant local effects over the short term. However, we also show how liabilities of smallness hinder the creation of significant sustainable local impact. Instead, the campus becomes an incubation space for novel institutional practices for regional development. Indeed, the most promising initiatives return to the original campus for scaling up.
   This study helps to characterize the entrepreneurial university by first presenting universities as drivers for sustainable change through education and outreach, rather than via traditional commercialization activities and notably in developing countries. Second, the study illustrates the risks and value of creating a separate space for novel concepts for sustainable development to be tested prior to returning these concepts to the principal location.

AB The acknowledgement of politics and institutions in developing countries is well in line with debates not only in the area of development effectiveness but also regarding new public management. Results-Based Approaches (RBApps), conceptually framed within these two debates, are designed to support outcome- and impact-oriented development goals. They link the achievement of results to monetary and/or non-monetary reward mechanisms. However, so far, development cooperation partners have mainly applied RBApps in the form of Results-Based Finance and Results-Based Aid. Through the provision of a conceptual framework, this paper embeds RBApps between different tiers of government within the discussion and applies Rwanda as a case study to it. Along the lines of Rwanda's Domestic Performance Approach Imihigo, the article argues that development co-operation should be more proactive in considering these approaches, as they might be crucial in terms of sustainability and serve as a promising entry point for programmes supported by development partners.

AB The question is whether the benefits of collaboration for innovation for small enterprises in China are comparable to or different from other developing countries-Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, and Nigeria-that have been surveyed by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM). When it comes to innovation, the benefits of collaboration for small firms in China, as in Brazil and Indonesia, are found to be negligible, whereas the benefits are substantial in Thailand and Nigeria. The benefits are measured in terms of innovation. The findings contribute to understanding collaboration as a systemic property that benefits innovation in small firms that are embedded in institutions that moderate that benefit.

AB Purpose This paper aims to raise awareness on current shifting of R&D activities from agricultural-based Agriculture and agriculture-related Natural Sciences (ANS) to industrial-based Engineering, Computer, and Industry-related Sciences (ECI) in Southeast Asian (SEA) economies. This trend might cause stiffer challenges on effort to sustain food security in the region. Design/methodology/approach Five SEA countries were selected, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. R&D data were collected over the years 2001-2014. Collected data were analysed using descriptive statistics and correlation. Findings Malaysia has been in the process of shifting from ANS to ECI cluster, whereas Vietnam and Indonesia followed the trend but about a decade behind; meanwhile, the Philippines and Thailand kept their focus on ANS clusters. Within the ANS cluster, Malaysia and Thailand leaned towards Modern Biosciences and Modelling (MBM) sub-clusters. The Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia were more focused on Agriculture and Conventional Biosciences (ACB) sub-cluster. ACB is more relevant and affordable to smallholder farmers. Shifting of R&D priority correlated with GDP per capita of SEA countries. Within ANS cluster, R&D activity in MBM increased but ACB decreased as GDP per capita increased.
   Research limitations/implications - Data used in this study were limited to accessible 2001-2014 data in five selected SEA economies. Therefore, there is an open possibility for future research on extended timeline using more sophisticated data analysis.
   Practical implications - Agricultural technology development should be relevant to needs of and affordable to smallholder farmers, as they are the primary food producers in developing economies.
   Social implications - If the R&D activities continue to drift away from farmer's needs, there will be a possible drawback of widening gap between developed agricultural technologies and absorptive capacity of smallholder farmers. Government institutions should revisit their R&D priority as the current trend could cause a serious obstacle in maintaining food security in the SEA region.
   Originality/value - This frontier study provides an early warning for government in SEA economies and other developing countries for balancing between R&D for supporting smallholder farmers in food production and for enhancing national economic growth.

AB Safe drinking water for all is unlikely to be achieved without major improvements in the sustainability of rural water supplies in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite heavy dependence on groundwater across the African continent, there is little empirical evidence on the relative reliability of different water-lifting technologies. This study comparatively evaluated the operational performance of the BluePump against the Afridev, India Mark II and PB Mark II handpumps. The field assessment took place in Turkana County (northern Kenya) and The Gambia, contexts with contrasting environmental, social and institutional characteristics. When controlling for other variables, in both study sites the BluePump had significantly lower odds of a breakdown occurring over a 12-month period compared with other handpumps. The BluePump also had significantly lower odds of a nonfunctional status relative to the Afridev in Turkana, though no significant effect on functionality was observed relative to the India Mark II in either study site or the PB Mark II in The Gambia. In Turkana, the impact of fewer breakdowns on operational uptime and point-in-time functionality may have been moderated by a subsidised maintenance service for which communities pay a fixed annual fee irrespective of handpump type and breakdown frequency. In The Gambia, the BluePump had significantly longer breakdowns than Mark II handpumps because of a problematic maintenance model. The results indicate that technological innovations such as the BluePump can lead to operational improvements, but technology alone is no panacea and the long-term sustainability of water supplies ultimately depends upon the effectiveness of maintenance services.

AB This study focuses on presenting the state of university libraries in Yemen, drawing upon observational research and in-depth interviews with 4 key university leaders, 12 teaching education program (TEP) chairpersons, 9 college deans, 6 vice-deans, 20 teaching professors, and 34 teacher training students within one higher education institution. The observational research has also covered five libraries of three private universities and two state ones. The findings outline the challenges faced by library users: the presence of traditional libraries, traditional resources and services, and the implementation of new policy. The study highlights the urgent need to redesign libraries, to increase libraries' budgets, and to establish digital resources and services, as well as a national library association.

AB This paper employs the patent data of four major genetically modified (GM) crops, soybeans, cotton, maize and rapeseed, to illustratee how the innovation of GM crop technology diffused and distributed globally over time. Data collected from the Derwent Innovation Index, were employed to construct country patent citation networks, from 1984 to 2015, and the results revealed that developed countries were early adopters, and the primary actors in the innovation of GM crop technology. Only seven developing countries appeared in the country citation network. Most developed countries were reluctant to apply GM crop technology for commercial cultivation. Private businesses stood out in the patent citation network. The early adoption and better performance of developed countries can be explained by the activities of large established private companies.

AB This paper aims to analyse the influence of structural characteristics and organizational determinants on the perception of obstacles to innovation in small developing countries. The study focuses on the interaction between these specific elements with important implications for both innovation policy and innovation management in the context of small emerging economies, which are generally characterized by financial and market constraints, weak institutional framework and low innovation performance. The empirical analysis is based on panel data of 5447 Ecuadorian firms from the National Survey of Innovation Activities for the periods 2009-2011 and 2012-2014. In contrast with the existing literature, which often analyses separately the influence of variables such as firm size or engagement in innovation activities on obstacles to innovation, this paper uses a nonlinear probability model to a better understanding of the interaction between both variables. In general, results show a greater perception of the obstacles as the size of the company decreases, across all the different levels of innovation activity. This result is observed for all obstacles to innovation, but is especially clear and straightforward for knowledge and economic barriers. When considering small firms, interaction between firm size and engagement in innovation activities reveals the existence of a learning effect based on one's own innovation effort and experience, which contributes to overcoming difficulties. These results suggest that actions focused on small organizational structures that aim to improve access to new sources of knowledge and optimise the availability and use of economic resources can contribute to channelling this innovation proactivity towards concrete innovations.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the institutional factors affecting the reform of public sector in Morocco. In particular, this study focuses on the adoption path of one such reform, in which Moroccan municipalities had to adopt economic and development plans (EDPs). Design/methodology/approach The paper's methodology adopts a qualitative approach. In particular, the paper adopts a mix of primary and secondary sources to analyze the historical development of the EDP reform in the Moroccan context, and the institutional factors involved in the implementation process. It contributes to the existing literature in two ways: it defines a tentative model that combines two approaches (new and old institutional theories); and it contextualizes the proposed model in the Moroccan context by examining the institutional process of implementing the reforms. Findings The reform that introduced EDPs in Morocco was the result of a collaboration between the Moroccan government and international donors. The introduction of EDPs was impeded by institutional features of Moroccan society. Therefore, the implementation of EDPs in Morocco did not change taken-for-granted ways of thinking, nor did it remove institutional restrictions and barriers. Municipalities were not affected by the modernizing effects of the reform. They are managed as traditional administrative structures, with very little capacity for organizational and management innovation. Originality/value The paper contributes to the debate on the adequacy of new public management (NPM) in less developed countries (LDCs), and in particular with regards to the use of strategic plans in Moroccan municipalities. In doing so, the paper attempts to define a tentative framework that combines new institutional and old institutional theory. The framework proposed helps to explain how NPM in LDCs was diffused and how institutional characteristics could hamper or foster the implementation of NPM reform.

AB Many breeding programs have been implemented in developing countries, many of which have been unsuccessful. To better understand the failure of these breeding programs, it is proposed to analyze their adequacy with innovations that are actually adopted by smallholders. The proposed methodology takes account of these innovations, the reasons for their adoption and the objectives of livestock keeping. The N'Dama cattle-breeding program in Senegal was used as a case study. Surveys were carried out among 54 farmers: 27 breeders who participated in this program, 17 of whom recently resigned, and 27 breeders who have never participated. Feeding was the most frequently cited area of innovation, followed by infrastructure. Genetics, animal health and reproduction held the third rank. Milk production appeared as an important objective of breeders, although the context remains one of strong multifunctionality. Principal component analysis highlighted three categories of breeders according to the innovations they adopted: institutional, modernizing, and integrating innovators. The groups of institutional and modernizing innovators dominate, gathering each 41% of the farmers. In the first category, breeders have organized themselves in an association and use N'Dama sires, livestock aiming at an insurance objective. In the second category, artificial insemination with exotic breeds and other technical innovations (cowshed, vaccination, urea treatment of straw) are used to improve production of milk and meat. The third group is termed 'integrating innovators,' since their innovations aim at integrating livestock and crop production. Gathering 18% of the sampled breeders, this group presents intermediate features between the two previous groups, using animals as draught power and for manure production. These results indicate that a process of intensification is at play and that the genetic improvement through the selection of N'Dama cattle for production criteria does not meet the breeders' demand. However, the N'Dama's adaptive traits justify its use as part of the breeding strategy of farmers, either in pure-breeding or in crossbreeding. The study thus tends to show the interactive link between genetic improvement and other innovations. It suggests that the success of a breeding program depends on its adequate positioning within the set of innovations adopted by breeders and proposes a method to inform breeding programs accordingly.

AB This article sheds light on the direct impact of technological as well as organizational innovation on firm-level employment growth using a global sample of over 15,000 firms in developing countries. The main findings suggest that new sales associated with product innovation are produced, on average, with just as much or higher levels of labor intensity than old products. However, the additionality to employment decreases with productivity, proxied by income per capita. In line with other studies, process innovation does not impact the additionality of employment, but there is some evidence of automation reducing the impact of product innovation on employment.

AB Irrigated agricultural production is viewed as key to the twin challenges of transforming agriculture and adapting to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Farmer-led irrigation is currently not well recognised or accounted for, and the current focus on state or public-private irrigation schemes means this activity is largely occurring outside of formal governance mechanisms or is deemed illegal. How do current institutional and regulatory frameworks relate to the apparent boom in farmer-led irrigation, and how do these shape current patterns of response, support, and regulation? To answer this question, we build a conceptual understanding of water governance which draws on critiques of current institutional frameworks for water and irrigation management, specifically using the conceptual ideas of isomorphic mimicry and capability traps, and elements of a problem-driven iterative adaptation (PDIA) approach. We then use three case studies from Tanzania and Malawi to illuminate three critical problems that state institutions encounter in approaching the recognition and regulation of farmer-led irrigation. In our conclusion we argue that current irrigation governance is creating capability traps for existing institutions. Where incremental and context-driven adaptation of governance is practised this can be avoided, creating better chances of effective support and regulation of farmer-led irrigation development.

AB This paper assesses the influence of technology transfer on the performance and sustainability of standard gauge railway in developing countries, particularly in Kenya. Using the integrated technology transfer model, the researcher gathered data through a semi-structured questionnaire from 165 Kenyan international students in China. The study used correlation and hierarchical models for content analysis. The findings show that effective technology transfer contributes positively to the performance and sustainability of standard gauge railway. Further, the results show areas of improvement that guarantee efficient rail technology transfer and are useful to advance the knowledge of technology transfer and offer a theoretical foundation of technology innovation transfer mechanisms. The study recommends collaborative efforts to promote local institutions to enhance local expertise of rail maintenance through curriculum reviews and establishing local technology transfer offices.

   Shenzhen, China

AB Cultivated land is a key resource and environmental factor for human survival and development, and internationally, special protection is generally imposed on cultivated land. China conducts the most stringent cultivated land protection system worldwide, but the restraint mechanism of rigid control with pure administration cannot change the continuous decreasing trend in the acreage and quality of cultivated land. Shenzhen, which is the city with the fastest economic growth in China and a highly urbanized area with a non-agricultural population, has very serious issues regarding cultivated land encroachment, spatially fragmented distribution, and land abandonment, which has rendered cultivated land protection extremely difficult. In this article, the present cultivated land protection situation in China and other countries is summarized, and the acreage change, spatial distribution, and land abandonment of cultivated land in Shenzhen are summarized and analyzed. Then, we propose an institutional framework for the transition of cultivated land protection in Shenzhen, which includes spatial optimization, management innovation, and safeguard systems. The implementation path to the transition of cultivated land protection includes a basic farmland reformation project, spatial usage control and zoning of cultivated land, tender and bid management for cultivated land leasing, and management innovation for facility agricultural land. The pros and cons of how non-agricultural populations impact cultivated land protection and the compound benefits, including the political, ecological, cultural, and technical aspects, of cultivated land protection in highly urbanized areas are discussed. This article notes the potential risks in management innovation in facility agricultural land. The proposed institutional framework for the transition of cultivated land protection and its implementation paths provide a reference for cultivated land protection and utilization in highly urbanized areas and suburbs with a heavy contradiction between economic growth and cultivated land protection in developing countries.

AB Citizen science is gaining increasing prominence as a tool for science and engagement. However, despite being a potentially valuable tool for sustainable development, citizen science has little visibility in many developing countries. We undertook a collaborative prioritisation process with experts in conservation and the environment to assess the potential of environmental citizen science in East Africa, including its opportunities, benefits and barriers. This provided principles that are applicable across developing countries, particularly for large-scale citizen science. We found that there was great potential for citizen science to add to our scientific knowledge of natural resources and biodiversity trends. Many of the important benefits of citizen science were for people, as well as the environment directly. Major barriers to citizen science were mostly social and institutional, although projects should also consider access to suitable technology and language barriers. Policy implications. Citizen science can provide data to support decision-making and reporting against international targets. Participation can also provide societal benefits, informing and empowering people, thus supporting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. In developing countries, innovation is needed to further develop culturally relevant citizen science that benefits participants and end users. This should be supported through regional networks of stakeholders for sharing best practice.

AB Conservation agriculture, drought tolerant maize, and improved legume varieties are key climate change management strategies for smallholder farmers in southern Africa. Their complementary efforts in adaptation to climate change are sternly important for farm productivity and income. This study evaluates factors explaining individual and multiple adoption of climate change management strategies and their differential impacts on productivity and income using a sample of 1172 smallholder farmers from Malawi and Zimbabwe. The study employs multinomial logistic regression to evaluate factors of individual and multiple adoption and regression adjustment with inverse probability weighting to evaluate impacts of the different adoption regimes on farm productivity and income. The results show that multiple adoption of innovations is mostly explained by access to key resources (credit, income and information), level of education and size of land owned by the farmer. More so, the concurrent adoption of conservation agriculture, stress adapted legume varieties and drought tolerant maize has far greater dividends on productivity and income than when considered individually. However, impacts of multiple adoption of the practices are not entirely uniform across different geographic regions and gender. Results suggest that effective institutional and policy efforts targeted towards reducing resource constraints that inhibit farmers' capacity to adopt complementary climate-smart agriculture packages such as conservation agriculture, drought tolerant maize and improved legume varieties must be gender sensitive and context specific.

AB Most research on entrepreneurial activities and institutions focuses on identifying certain relationships between formal and informal institutions and entrepreneurship across economies. In this study, we advance entrepreneurship research by examining how social capital as a characteristic of the institutional environment affects the relationship between formal and informal institutions and entrepreneurial activities, differentially, in developing and developed economies. Supporting institutional theory and social capital theory, the results from our sample of 39 countries from 2001 to 2014, which contains over 30,000 identified individuals, indicate that social capital has a stronger influence in the relations between institutions and entrepreneurship. In developing countries, this influence is greater in the relationship between property rights, access to credit, subjective insecurity, and entrepreneurial activity. In developed countries, the greater effect of social capital is on the relationship between corruption and entrepreneurial activity.

AB Researchers and policymakers have been interested in promoting entrepreneurship in Europe because of its positive implications for employment, productivity, and economic growth. We use Hayton, George, and Zahra's (2002) Model of Culture's Association with Entrepreneurship to consider the implications of economic conditions, informal institutions (culture), and formal institutions for regional entrepreneurship rates. Measuring regional entrepreneurship as self-employment rates, our multilevel analysis shows a significant negative relationship between country-level labor market regulations (strictness) and entrepreneurship rates, a negative relationship between Individualism (vs. Collectivism) and entrepreneurship rates, and a negative relationship between regional unemployment and entrepreneurship rates across 186 European regions in 20 countries. We discuss implications for theory, linking formal and informal institutions and economic conditions with entrepreneurship, and for regional policy, particularly in Europe.

AB Purpose - There has been a high rate of failure among the Living Labs in Kenya resulting in the expected outcomes not fully realized. This paper aims to assess the sustainability of Living Labs in Kenya.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on the four capital method of sustainable development evaluation framework, data were collected through interviews and questionnaires from innovators, users and employees among the 25 living labs in Kenya.
   Findings - The research found that some innovators are not familiar with the living labs, the living labs are innovative and prepared to survive in future, some labs have strategic plans on how to pursue future environment and have developed ways of choosing right people to incubate, inability to get enough funding from the host organizations and limited knowledge on the supervision level of the operations. A model is proposed that can be generalized to other living labs in developing countries.
   Research limitations/implications - The study was done in Nairobi where most of the living labs are situated.
   Practical implications - The study concludes by emphasizing on the user involvement during innovation process. There is need to expand the capacities of living labs to accommodate more people to ensure more innovations are supported at a time. The senior managers in charge of the living labs should increase the level of supervision to ensure that the labs are effective in their incubation efforts and institutionalize support of the host organization to the labs to ensure continued growth and expansion.
   Originality/value - The findings of this study are of value to research community, the decision and policymakers as it seeks to document the current status of the living labs in the Kenya

AB This is the background paper for the productivity extension of the World Bank's Long-Term Growth Model (LTGM). Based on an extensive literature review, the paper identifies the main determinants of economic productivity as innovation, education, market efficiency, infrastructure, and institutions. Based on underlying proxies, the paper constructs indexes representing each of the main categories of productivity determinants and, combining them through principal component analysis, obtains an overall determinant index. This is done for every year in the three decades spanning 1985-2015 and for more than 100 countries. In parallel, the paper presents a measure of total factor productivity (TFP), largely obtained from the Penn World Table, and assesses the pattern of productivity growth across regions and income groups over the same sample. The paper then examines the relationship between the measures of TFP and its determinants. The variance of productivity growth is decomposed into the share explained by each of its main determinants, and the relationship between productivity growth and the overall determinant index is identified. The variance decomposition results show that the highest contributor among the determinants to the variance in TFP growth is market efficiency for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and education for developing countries in the most recent decade. The regression results indicate that, controlling for country- and time-specific effects, TFP growth has a positive and significant relationship with the proposed TFP determinant index and a negative relationship with initial TFP. This relationship is then used to provide a set of simulations on the potential path of TFP growth if certain improvements on TFP determinants are achieved. The paper presents and discusses some of these simulations for groups of countries by geographic region and income level. In addition, as a country-specific illustration, the paper presents simulations on the potential path of TFP growth for Peru under various scenarios. An accompanying Excelbased toolkit, linked to the LTGM, provides a larger set of simulations and scenario analysis at the country level for the next few decades.

AB In the face of slowing economies globally, the construction industry faces many challenges such as socio-economic stress, resource shortages, institutional weaknesses and a general inability to respond to key issues. These have intensified and become more severe in recent years. Empirical research in supply chain management points to barriers that limit construction industries in developing countries such as South Africa. This paper aims to explore supply chain constraints in the South African construction industry. Relevant literature was reviewed and insights from 15 experienced supply chain practitioners were elicited by means of semi-structured interviews. Content analysis was employed using the ATLAS.ti (version 7) software to analyse qualitative data. Six themes emerged from the interviews, which include lack of investment in supply chains, lack of supply chain innovation process constraints, supply chain change management, supply chain collaboration, supply chain leadership, and time management. It is recommended that construction companies adopt supply chain management systems, integrated solutions, and collaborative project management tools and technologies.

TI Platform Interactions and Evolution of Ola's Organizational Field
SO AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Platforms; Institutional Theory; Organizational Field; Ola; India
ID INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP; LOGICS
AB Most digital enterprises begin as technology start-ups offering niche services, and then evolve into digital platforms providing a range of services. Against the backdrop of almost nonexistent logistic and supply chain infrastructure, weak regulatory framework, low penetration of smartphones and Internet, low consumer confidence and trust on online transactions, digital entrepreneurs in developing countries literally have to build the platform ecosystem along with their organization. In this paper, we use institutional theory as a lens to trace the emergence and evolution of digital platforms in India. We posit that digital platforms are emerging organizational fields embodying new network logics with algorithms and technology-mediated interactions playing a central role in creating value. In particular, we take the case of Ola, an online cab aggregator from India to illustrate that digital platforms as organizational field evolve through three phases of (a) innovation introduction, (b) mobilization and (c) structuration. In the first phase, the organizational field characteristics are consequences of activities undertaken to raise cognitive legitimacy and respond to competitive forces. In the second phase, a mix of coercive and mimetic forces shape the institutional field resulting in increase in socio-political legitimacies. In the third phase, the process of structuration sets in as isomorphic forces become more normative. The theoretical framework developed in this paper contributes to extant information system research by putting forth that the characteristics of emerging organizational field are shaped by the interplay between the responses of the focal organization to isomorphic forces, and the actions taken by it to establish cognitive and socio-political legitimacies. Empirically the study is on digital platforms located in a large developing country with very high potential for online transactions but relatively low penetration of Internet and smartphones. Conceptualizing organizational field as digital platforms enables making sense of the changing business landscape, and examine issues of sustainability and legitimacy.

AB Purpose: This study examined knowledge sharing mechanisms in coffee IPs and their effect on actor linkages in four districts of Uganda.
   Design/methodology/approach: Thirty one respondents from the public and private sector were interviewed using a qualitative approach. Data were analyzed using the Atlas ti qualitative software version 7.5.18 to generate themes for information sources, types and channels. Social network analysis was used to measure the actor centrality positions and influence in the IP network.
   Findings: Results revealed seven main categories of actors in the Coffee IPs who shared information on coffee inputs, agronomic practices, processing and markets through three main channels. Level of cohesion was less than 10% which had negative implications on the knowledge flow, trust and collaboration among the actors. Influential positions were occupied by the processors and farmer leaders in IPs in the southern districts of Luwero and Rakai, while nursery operators were most influential in IPs of the western districts of Ntungamo and Bushenyi. Weak linkages within the social networks indicated that initiatives of the actors were fragmented, as each actor acted as an individual detached from the platform activities limiting inter-actor knowledge sharing.
   Practical implications: Innovation intermediaries should focus on integrated systemic and innovative approaches to strengthen actor social linkages for knowledge sharing and better platform performance.
   Theoretical implications: Actor positions and relationships in innovation networks are critical tenets for fostering knowledge exchange and performance. In an innovation platform, diverse actors are multiple sources for accessing information within a given social and institutional context.
   Originality/value: The study contributes to existing debate and knowledge on institutional change in agricultural innovation systems.

AB Purpose: To develop a transformative learning process around the potential for innovation of technologies such as Conservation Agriculture.
   Design/methodology/approach: We applied principles of Transformative Learning and Communicative Action theories to design a learning process structured by the Qualitative Expert Assessment Tool for Conservation Agriculture Adoption in Africa (QAToCA). Elements of the process include: agroecosystem health exploration, stakeholder mapping, innovation timeline, participatory video, the QAToCA exercise, and specifying change promotion. We tested this approach with a group of farmers and experts in Koumbia, Burkina Faso.
   Findings: The agroecosystem in Koumbia is under demographic, economic, and climatic pressure. Conservation Agriculture has not been successfully integrated into socio-economic realities or implemented beyond a trial scale. The stakeholder mapping showed that dominant economic players and traditional means of communicating are essential to achieve innovation. Past interventions were not coordinated and focused on technical challenges. The participatory videos were rich in contextual information and created process ownership for research participants. The QAToCA provided a structure for lessons learned and suggestions for change.
   Practical implications: The learning process may be applied to initiate innovation initiatives in an efficient manner.
   Theoretical implications: The study shows how Transformative Learning and Communicative Action theories can be used for agricultural innovation. It also underlines the need for further work on how to address the implicit superiority of the process initiator and the integration of learning in institutional practice.
   Originality: Few studies have attempted to design and test learning processes on agricultural innovation based on theories of learning and Communicative Action.

   POPULAR DISCONTENT?
SO TEORIJA IN PRAKSA
LA English
DT Article
DE free-trade agreements; policy space; institutional innovations;
   inclusive development; regulatory autonomy; dispute resolution mechanism
AB The difference between the post-war development of international legal trade regimes and the context of the latest free-trade initiatives is that the disparate effects of trade liberalisation have also become visible in the most advanced economies in the world, including the United States and the European Union, not only in developing countries. This trend requires a rethinking of trade arrangements that would provide suitable instruments, tools and policies when needed for restructuring. The key challenge in the process of deepening and widening the economic and legal integration is how to disseminate the economic, technological, financial and other benefits to those regions and parts of the population that are currently excluded. In order to overcome this negative trend, comprehensive efforts to disseminate the benefits as widely as possible should be applied at the local, national and international levels.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the value of decolonial approaches (DAs) such as epistemic locus (Mignolo, 1995, 2000) in studying innovation.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a case study of a stem cell surgical innovation developed in India. A critical hermeneutic analysis method has been followed for data analysis.
   Findings Epistemic locus influences the framing of the problem, perceptions of risks/opportunities as well as the envisioning of alternate institutional systems. Persistent and strategic effort at building connections changes local improvisation into a globally legitimate innovation.
   Research limitations/implications It indicates the value of using DAs for innovation studies especially epistemic locus, enactment and connections in understanding knowledge generation and innovation.
   Practical implications Innovation in Global South can be encouraged by giving more space to the innovator to attempt or experiment. More conscious conversation of epistemic locus of the researcher could help.
   Social implications Countries have to move beyond a mere technological imitation to include discussions on epistemic imitation. Epistemic imitation prevents one from seeing what one has and one only looks at conditions from the eyes of the dominator.
   Originality/value This study documents the development of an innovation from an Indian epistemic locus which differs from a western epistemic locus and the impact this has on an innovation.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish why firms in developing countries are slow to adopt integrated reporting (IR) and what needs to be done to ensure such firms embrace the practice of integrated reporting using evidence from Uganda.
   Design/methodology/approach This study uses a narrative cross sectional survey conducted using qualitative data collection techniques specifically the structured interviews. We conducted interviews on senior executive managers of Capital Markets Authority, Professional accountancy bodies, Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) and firms listed on Uganda Securities Exchange. The study also involved an analysis of annual reports of listed firms on USE from 2010 to 2016.
   Findings Results suggest that, firms are slow to adopt integrated reporting because of the scarce resources, culture and leadership, stakeholders demand, the regulatory requirement, the effect of globalization and the mindset, lack of awareness about IR and the nature of business and size. Results further suggest that integrated reporting be made mandatory for all firms, especially those that are publicly interested, such as financial institutions, and those that are listed on the stock exchange.
   Originality/value IR being an emerging phenomenon there are few empirical studies exploring IR practices in a developing economy perspective. To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first paper that provides some insights into IR from a Ugandan perspective using the Diffusion of innovation theory.

AB This paper analyzes capacity building in practice, addressing the expectations, imaginaries and experiences of health researchers from Mozambique and Angola. The empirical data stems from the Erasmus+ funded project "University Development and Innovation - Africa (UDI-A)", a consortium established between European and African institutions to promote the mobility and empowerment of African academics, the establishment of North/South research partnerships and the strengthening of African institutions. Through qualitative research methods - semi-structured interviews and a focus group with African participants, and participant observation - this article analyzes the experiences of African academics working in the health field, their perceptions of capacity building and aspirations during their stay in Portugal in 2018. By addressing some of their concerns and achievements, this paper reflects on the performativity of capacity building methodologies, exploring a wide range of issues that emerge within the framework of North/South partnerships, inquiring whether it would be possible to decolonize capacity-building methodologies.

ID FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE
AB Science should be capable of covering issues as diverse as farming systems, technology, innovation, climate change adaptation, poverty alleviation, extension, policy and practice, as they all relate to sustainable agriculture and development. Some years ago, the call for a new farming systems approach was raised to accommodate the principles of interdisciplinary, systems thinking and participatory research. Society calls for systems performance that provides stability and sustainability (SDGs!), multi-scale and territorial approaches and looks for solutions for critical issues such as employment, migration and inclusion/exclusion at the global level (World Society). We propose here a way in dealing with this complexity by addressing the mentioned problem from the communication and symbolic perspective, i.e. to consider the "object" within agricultural science but mainly observe the dedicated systems of communication. By using the concept of social systems, we can accommodate under it systems as diverse as farms, extension organizations, innovation patterns, (agricultural) sciences, policy and politics, farmer and indigenous knowledge, markets and value chains, but always in the form of communication. As such, we remain within a discipline with the potential to evolve towards a promising sub-discipline of agricultural sciences (or of sociology?). The relatively new farming approach of certified organic in combination with agroecology is relevant for family farms and small-scale entities. It depends much more on societal support for extension, technology development and policy coherence than commercial farms. Organic agriculture, with its standards, technological requirements and consumer preferences is nested in socio-economic and political networks, which makes it challenging for researchers to integrate the various components. This challenge applies particularly to countries with poorly developed institutions, weak organizations and within the context of poverty and rural exodus. We therefore use a unified approach under a single scientific system. This system observes, analyses and reports on communication aspects of involved (observed!) social systems (including networks and interactions) within the society of any given nation, including the realities of globalized markets. We are developing a case study based in Mali, in which we apply this method. The case is describing a planning process involving cotton farmers from the Sikasso region, the cotton industry, public and private extension systems, farmer organizations, local governments, the NARS (IER), FiBL, donors and the national institutions involved in climate change adaptation and food security. Various technological options of production (conventional, organic) and farming systems are available. The reflexive use of science dealing with human behavior may facilitate the pragmatic participation of researchers from various disciplines in addressing the uncertainties and opportunities that lie ahead of us and achieve the required impacts together with the practitioners.

AB During the past few decades, developing countries have been pushed by international economic institutions and developed countries to effectively abandon promotion of industrialization and structural transformation as a key developmental agenda. In addition, the development' debate of recent decades has tended to focus solely on internal factors as if external economic forces are always benign. Within this context, this paper analyzes the key ideas of Gebrehiwot Baykedagn (GHB) (1886-1919), traces their lineages and considers their feasibility and relevance for current developing economies. In a nutshell, for GHB, the main keys to economic development are the creation, accumulation and use of knowledge and skill, technology, innovation and technical change and the means of economic development are deliberate, dynamic and comprehensive sets of state-directed, synergistic interventions that aim at moving an economy away from nature-intensive' economic activities towards knowledge-, skill-, technology- and innovation-based ones. Based on analysis of historical and theoretical evidence, this paper argues that the main ideas of GHB and his colleagues are still valid, feasible and relevant for today's developing economies as long as they are innovatively tailored to the unique context of each country and to the broader international policy context.

AB The collaborative innovation of Low Carbon Environmental Friendly Technology (LCEFT) takes an important role in coping with climate change for developing countries. Because of the high innovation cost, high risk and uncertainty of revenues, financial institutions are introduced in. And the model's basic hypothesis is the cooperative relationship with enterprises. Then we can build an evolutionary game model of LCEFT collaborative innovation with muti-subjects of government, enterprises, financial institutions and research institutions. Thus we can explore the decision-making conditions of independent innovation and collaborative innovation of enterprises supported by green finance. And a conclusion through an analog simulation of the influence of pledge of carbon right, credit rating, penalty and subsidies by Matlab model. Then conclusions are: (1) the green support strategy from financial institutions can promote the collaborative innovation of enterprises, but the effectiveness of the green support strategy is not only affected by the government subsidies and punishment mechanism, but also affected by the profitability and risk of green credit projects. (2) The complementarity of multi-subjects in resources and capabilities is key force for the formation of LCEFT collaborative innovation alliance and an important source of additional benefits for innovation subjects. (3) Subsidy and punishment mechanisms implemented by government will also actively promote multi-subject cooperation, which is conducive to collaborative innovation of LCEFT, but not an overall optimal strategy. The key to achieve overall optimal result is to effectively play the role of guidance from government and lever from financial institutions.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the government roles in cloud computing assimilation along two dimensions: government regulation and government support.
   Design/methodology/approach A research model was developed to depict the dual roles of government regulation and government support in cloud computing assimilation as well as the mediating effect of top management support (TMS). Using survey data collected from 376 Chinese firms that have already adopted cloud services, the authors tested the research model.
   Findings The impacts of both government regulation and government support on cloud computing assimilation are partially mediated by TMS. Government support exerts stronger impacts on TMS than government regulation.
   Research limitations/implications This study extends the current information systems literature by highlighting the specific mechanisms through which governments influence firms' assimilation of cloud computing.
   Practical implications Governments in developing countries could actively allocate funds or enact policies to effectively encourage cloud computing assimilation.
   Originality/value This study would complement previous findings about government regulation, and develop a more holistic understanding about the dual roles of governments in information technology innovation assimilation.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the relationship between five green practices and firm performance. In addition, this paper investigates the influence of each green practice on environmental performance, economic benefits, and economic costs.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were collected based on a cross-sectional survey of owner/managers of 200 manufacturing SME firms in Uganda, Africa. SPSS was used to find descriptive means and test relationships between green practices and performance outcomes. Structural equation modelling was used to test for the influence of each practice on performance outcomes. The structural equation modelling results were obtained using the Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modelling software. Results were compared with similar studies conducted in developing countries.
   Findings Different green practices affect different performance dimensions in different ways across different industries. For example, eco-design and internal environmental management practices significantly influence environmental performance; green purchasing and internal environmental management practices significantly influence economic benefits; and internal environmental management practices affect economic costs. Overall internal environmental management is the key to positive outcomes across the three performance criteria. The authors show how the results obtained vary from similar studies conducted in developing countries and explain possible reasons for the difference.
   Research limitations/implications Africa is a rapidly industrialising nation faced with difficult choices between economic growth and increased pollution. Because SMEs represent the majority of manufacturing firms, they are the main polluters. Hence, better understanding of the costs and benefits, both environmental and economic, is important to encourage green practice adoption for the betterment of community health and prosperity.
   Originality/value Despite numerous studies on the relationships between green practice adoption and performance outcomes, only a few studies include both economic costs and benefits in addition to environmental performance. The study covers five green supply chain practices, whereas most similar studies are limited in the number of practices examined. The African context is unique and important because industrial development and environmental protection goals are in conflict. Similar studies are predominant in an Asian context which is more developed than Africa. The findings and comparisons raise important questions for further research in relation to the roles of national regulations, geographical markets and industry types in furthering green practices in manufacturing.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how corporate environmental management strategies at different environmental management maturity (EMM) stages are influenced by institutional forces in the service sector organizations of a developing country.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors used a multiple case study approach in this study. Institutional isomorphic pressures (coercive, mimetic and normative) at different EMM stages were used as the analytical framework.
   Findings The study finds coercive pressures largely shape the corporate environmental management strategies at the reactive stage while mimetic pressures have the greatest influence on the internal integration stage. Combined mimetic and normative pressures influence the environmental strategies at the external integration stage. Further, it emphasizes the importance of various institutional pressures in propelling the organizations in the developing countries to benefit from higher levels of EMM.
   Originality/value This paper offers a new theoretical approach that highlights the importance of considering the institutional influence of the top-down process of diffusion and simultaneous counter-process of invention by which the lower level organizational actors shape and change their environmental management practices for corporate EMM.

AB Small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) located in the least developed countries (LDCs), operate in distinctively hostile institutional environments compared to those in developed economies. Better understanding of the determinants of SME innovation in such environments is important for the development of private sector in LDCs, because innovative SMEs are crucial for sustainable economic growth. Yet, determinants of SME innovation in LDCs have hardly been studied. Considering the potential relevance of internationalization for SME innovation in LDCs, as means of overcoming domestic environmental constraints, this paper investigates the influence of foreign technology licensing, exports and imports on SME innovation in LDCs.
   The study employs data from 1058 manufacturing SMEs from Sub-Saharan LDCs - Djibouti, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The findings suggest that foreign technology licensing is found to be positively and statistically associated with SME product and process innovations in Sub-Saharan LDCs. Findings are compared with those from developed economies in order to identify distinctive features. The implication is that SMEs in Sub-Saharan LDCs need to be supported by different policies compared to developed economies.
   The results also show that R&D, firm size, sectoral characteristics and access to finance are important determinants of SME innovation.

AB Entrepreneurship contributes importantly to the economy. However, differences in the quality and quantity of entrepreneurship vary significantly across developing and developed countries. We use a sample of 70 countries over the period of 2005-2015 to examine how formal and informal institutional dimensions (availability of debt and venture capital, regulatory business environment, entrepreneurial cognition and human capital, corruption, government size, government support) affect the quality and quantity of entrepreneurship between developed and developing countries. Our results demonstrate that institutions are important for both the quality and quantity of entrepreneurship. However, not all institutions play a similar role; rather, there is a dynamic relationship between institutions and economic development.

AB Using Ethiopia's maize production as a case study, this paper examines the uses of maize biomass as a bioeconomy crop, and its implications and challenges for household food security. In the context of this study, bioeconomy refers to the production and utilization of biological resources or biomass to provide products, processes and services. The study followed a mixed methods approach that involved a household survey covering 322 randomly selected farmers, key informant interviews and focus group discussions in Ethiopia. We examined the implication of intensity of biomass use on farm household food security using an endogenous switching regression model. The study found multiple areas of use of maize biomass, although many of them were underdeveloped and underutilized. Model results further showed a positive and significant effect of diversification of use of biomass on the food security of farm households. Raising the quantity of maize biomass is important to enhance farm household food security as it allows farm households to increase the amount of biomass allocated for individual use and also to use it for diverse purposes. Yet, a broad set of factors including lack of market access, limited information and extension support on the uses of biomass, and a lack of biomass value-adding technologies have restricted the full potential of biomass utilization. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of provision of these factors in order to unlock the potential of biomass for food security and advance the development of the bioeconomy.

AB This paper examines how oil palm migrant farmers in Papua New Guinea are responding to shortages of land for food gardening. Despite rapid population growth and planting nearly all of their land to oil palm, virtually all families continue to grow sufficient food for their families. The paper outlines the diverse range of adaptive strategies that households have employed to maintain food security, involving both intensification and innovation in farming systems. While gains from intensification have been significant and built resilience, they have been incremental, whereas innovation has been transformative and led to large gains in resilience. The adoption of more flexible land access arrangements on state leasehold land that revive' and adapt indigenous systems of land sharing and exchange that operated through kinship networks on customary land are innovative; they have increased the supply of land for food gardening thereby reducing risk for individual households and the broader smallholder community. The paper highlights the value of understanding farmer-driven innovations and the role of indigenous institutions and cultural values in sustaining and enhancing household food security.

AB This is a case study of a program to address professionalism at the Universidad de la RepAblica in Uruguay. We describe a five-year ongoing international collaboration. Relevant characteristics of the context, the program components, activities, and results were analyzed. The expected outcomes were to introduce standards of professional practices in the curricula of medical students and residents and the implementation of a program that might lead to a significant change in the culture of medicine in the University. Traditional didactics, interactive theater, and professional development workshops, issues such as teamwork and communication, professional behavior, and the culture of medicine, and physician wellness were addressed. A total of 359 faculty members, general practitioners, stakeholders, and other healthcare professionals (nurses, psychologists, social workers) participated in the intervention. The process led to specific achievements including new content in the curricula, the use of educational innovations to address issues of professionalism, a growing institutional culture of accountability, and the establishment of new rules and regulations. The strategies and interventions followed in the case of Uruguay can serve as a model to other developing countries to promote physician professionalism, wellness, and joy.

AB This paper examines the strategies and routines adopted by small and medium-sized suppliers to develop capabilities that enable them to engage in upgrading, despite a precarious relational and institutional context. To this end, we investigate the strategic behaviour of two Bangladeshi garment manufacturers. Both started out as small suppliers for multinational enterprises (MNEs) and have eventually grown into micro-multinationals. The firms are involved in 'tacit promissory contracting' with their buyers, a specific form of international outsourcing relationship. The study adopts a multiple case study design that involves interviews with managers/owners of the firms. The analysis yields two key findings. Both firms have devised strategies and taken coherent routines involving actions to develop skills and motivation needed to perform appropriate functional activities (i.e. pre-production, production and post-production) as they embarked on different stages of upgrading. Furthermore, firms have designed routines to internalise the challenges originating from their relationships with their buyers and the institutional environment at the time that had the potential to affect their upgrading goals. The paper contributes to IB studies by highlighting how suppliers, even in a precarious context, can control their own strategies and routines, so as to develop capabilities that allow them to gradually redress the power imbalance between themselves and their buyers.

AB Are rents, or excess profits, good for development? Rents could induce firms to lobby or bribe governments to preserve the status quo; on the other hand, rents may promote growth by giving firms the needed funds to make investments in fixed capital or research and development. To test this question empirically, we use a panel of manufacturing data at the industry-country-year level, and measure rents by the mark-up ratio. We find that the relationship between rents and growth is strongly negative, with the results being primarily driven by the poorer countries (or those with worse institutions) in the sample. This result holds when we instrument for mark-up using the average mark-up in other industries in the country. Even in industries with high external financing needs and countries with less developed financial sectors, precisely the places where excess profits could be used to drive growth, we find that rents are especially harmful. Consistent with the rent-seeking mechanism we highlight, we find that high rents are associated with a slower reduction in tariffs. We also test for the most likely alternative mechanism, that higher rents cause slower growth through the channel of allowing managerial slack. We find that controlling for management has little impact on our estimate of the impact of mark-up on productivity growth. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Organizational scholars and academicians in developed countries have been empirically highlighting the significance of market orientation (MO) for university performance (UP) using the traditional measures. While the present study, attempts to address the dearth of research in a developing country by empirically testing not only the MO UP relationship but also analyzing empirically the individual impact of the context specific dimensions of MO on UP based on the notion that different geographic, social and time zones create different context, so the relationship of interest might appear to vary when tested through separate dimensions independently. This would ultimately help university authorities recognize which aspects of MO to concentrate more for enhanced UP. A total of 476 university teachers and administrators participated from the five biggest and oldest public universities from Sind region. The use of structural equation modeling revealed that although the overall MO is quite significant to UP, yet the MO dimensions that appear more significant in previous literature, have a very unexpectedly different response in the developing countries. Contributions and implications of the study are outlined with reference to how the more context specific MO dimensions can contribute individually in the settings of public universities of a developing country like Pakistan.

AB This study is a post-project evaluation of three development projects promoting the same technology but implemented at three different times and locations over a period of thirty years, from 1984 to 2014. The technology in question is a small, portable palm oil expeller invented in Cameroon in the 1980 s. The technology was designed to increase the productivity of small farmers and create employment opportunities by increasing local capacity for small-scale palm oil processing. The expeller was subsequently promoted in Benin and Liberia over a period of nearly two decades. This evaluation is based on archival research of institutional records, data from impact surveys of technology users in all three countries during the project periods, and field research in Liberia in 2011 and 2013. The study analyzes and evaluates the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the expeller over the long term, comparatively, across a broad geographic area. In terms of social and economic impacts, the technology consistently increased incomes for farmers and small enterprises. The use of the technology altered relationships of production, particularly with regard to the role of women in palm oil processing and their control over resources. Environmental impacts of the technology are geographically dispersed and include increased water usage and pollution. Ultimately the technology in question has also contributed to political impacts over time by exacerbating conflicts between small farmers, palm oil corporations, and governments. This study confirms that comparative, longitudinal evaluation research can reveal important dimensions of development impacts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article describes the process and analyses the results of a project in Ethiopia establishing an innovation platform (IP) as a tool for co-creation from an innovation systems perspective. The results are encouraging, suggesting positive effects both on yields, but more importantly on the capacity and role of participants as communicators and agents of change in the community. The IP seems promising in creating new networks and modes of communication. The importance of good facilitation, commitment by all members from the start, and feedback loops driving the process was found to be essential.

AB This paper examines the relationship between corruption, transaction costs as measured by asset specificity, and innovation in Africa. We hypothesize that in the context of developing countries in Africa, corruption is positively associated with innovation. In addition, we hypothesize that this relationship is mediated by physical asset specificity and human asset specificity. These hypotheses are tested by means of a multiple mediation model. The product of coefficients approach and bootstrapping techniques are used to estimate firm-level data from the 2013 World Bank Enterprise Survey and 2013 Innovation Follow-up Survey. The results from the estimations reveal that corruption is positively associated with innovation, and that physical asset specificity mediates this relationship. There is no evidence suggesting that human asset specificity mediates the relationship between corruption and innovation. We conclude that the positive relationship between corruption and innovation offers support to the hypothesis that corruption 'greases-the-wheels' of innovation in Africa. Furthermore, physical asset specificity increases the likelihood of innovation in a business environment characterized by a high degree of corruption.

AB Xanthomonas Wilt of Banana (BXW) is a complex problem in the African Great Lakes Region that is affecting the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers. Since the first disease reports from Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2001, BXW has been studied widely. The majority of these studies focus on the technological or biophysical dimensions, while aspects and influence of socio-cultural, economic and institutional dimensions only recently started to gain attention. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the broader BXW problem using a systems perspective, with the aim to add to the understanding about reasons for poor uptake of appropriate disease management practices, and limited ability to prevent rather than control BXW in the region. We comprehensively describe and analyse the various problem dimensions, and determine relations with data, information, knowledge, and connectivity. Building on this, the paper explores and discusses entry-points for the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and citizen science tools to better address BXW in banana production systems.

TI Displacement and solidarity: An ethic of place-making

AB When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including 'serial displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them, their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine. Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. 'We are place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, 'never without emplaced experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as 'ecological subjects'. By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people, non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for 'ethical place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an ideal and practice of 'ethical place-making' as an essential and, indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol Gould has called 'solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects, above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance justice.
   A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as Gould puts it, a crucial 'role not only in motivating people's commitment to the realization of global justice but [also] contribut[ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany. In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy, or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the conclusion. Place 'is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers, philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn, bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines 'place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions and features of the external environment, including place-related factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable health inequities. We are talking about components of the built environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality, street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence, access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern. So-called 'determinants' such as these operate independently and interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured, are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health. Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design, including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc.
   ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the 19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures who need care and who also need to 'fit' with the places in which we dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice, solidarity involves two core 'enacted commitments'. The first commitment is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of the displaced and others who are 'implaced' in conditions unable to sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term, 'solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls 'rigorous recognition' and 'generous recognition'.
   Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as 'solidaristic recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and focuses on our 'mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic recognition conceives of others as 'equal in their difference', that is, their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity. On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties, neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic recognition (similar to Gould's 'rigorous recognition') might be expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be 'in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects. This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea that we are 'made by and making [our] relations in [asymmetrical] reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple, diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically, place in relational terms, highlights 'the variety of interactions between people who are located differently that go into making places'. As Iris Young puts it, we 'dwell together' in 'complex, causal' relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes, and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then, contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally - through actions and interactions within a larger context of social structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities, identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires to respond and work toward promoting justice.
   Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity, is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign 'responsiveness' a prominent place in their work. Springer situates 'responsiveness' within virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability, particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns that 'resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as also involving a commitment to 'extend a temporally continuous thread of attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance 'to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity, enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly evidence-based, is underway. 'Place-making' is a set of intentional practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods, parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments, streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow central to key international documents and declarations including the Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to place-based interventions as 'the new frontier'. In other work I have interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the geography literature, as a core component of an enabling, capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health. Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains pertinent to bioethics.
   After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of community and public health with an urban planning example, and from there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of the world.
   In [a] system of the city as weaving, [creating] crosswise threads enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of movement horizontal ellipsis 'Intentional shrinkage', 'sorting', and 'serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and 'development' policies that systematically shredded the social and material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a 'crime-prevention' measure for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its designers say, 'weaving', 're-stitching' - the GP helps restore these and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and unimpeded movement is being celebrated as 'a victory for the city's entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic recognition of) the importance of place for health and most significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues, yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity. Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for political engagement generated by the GP.
   As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as ecological subjects.
   We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients' experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects - here patients and their families - in the 'care' of institutions built as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into practice a concept known as 'secure base', which wraps around patients and families 'like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room. In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer, and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space. Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict, allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors. The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged and active, and experience better overall 'well-being'.
   Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and health.
   European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and practice of 'solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments. Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed, is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration, highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities, hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity, supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a 'cosmopolitan avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called 'resilience' strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making.
   In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear, discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one architect saw an opportunity: 'I thought by promoting place-making in Lebanon we can join the efforts of local [civil society] actors, since horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building. Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance, humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a place-making intervention to 'changing therapeutic geographies' in modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on the creation of 'therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places, young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context, emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU. Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens - recognize the 'users', let us say 'dwellers', as ecological subjects and respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities, chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us, indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their insecure relationship to place.
   On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in precarious conditions, and perhaps others.

INTRODUCTION PLACE AND HEALTH: ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTIVITY AND SOLIDARITY Solidaristic recognition Responsiveness SOLIDARITY (AND HEALTH JUSTICE) ENACTED: ETHICAL PLACE-MAKING Community and public health Care settings Refugee assistance and integration The elements of ethical place-making CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Drawing on a conception of people as 'ecological subjects', creatures situated in specific social relations, locations, and material environments, I want to emphasize the importance of place and place-making for basing, demonstrating, and forging future solidarity. Solidarity, as I will define it here, involves reaching out through moral imagination and responsive action across social and/or geographic distance and asymmetry to assist other people who are vulnerable, and to advance justice. Contained in the practice of solidarity are two core 'enacted commitments', first, to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need and, second, to responsive action.
   Recognizing the suffering of displacement and responding through place-making should follow from even the most simplistic understanding of people as 'implaced'. Recognition, furthermore, that places are created and sustained, transformed, or neglected in ways that foster or perpetuate inequities, including health inequities, generates responsibilities concerning place-making. Place-based interventions, on either count, should be principal and, indeed, prioritized ways of showing solidarity for the vulnerable and promoting justice. Where solidaristic relations do not prevail, place-making can catalyze and nurture them, and over time advance justice. On the moral landscapes of bioethics, the terrain where care and health are or should be at the center of attention, an ethic of place and place-making for those who have been displaced - patients, the elderly, urban populations, and asylum-seekers, for instance - expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity.

AB The robust economic growth of developing countries revived discussions about the need for a global financial architecture that is more representative of today's economic and political realities. The world is now markedly different from the moment the Bretton Woods institutions were created. The BRICS now account for a substantive share of global GDP, however, this was not reflected in equivalent voting power in existing multilateral institutions. As a response, they created institutions like the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Agreement (CRA), symbolizing a shift of economic and political power towards emerging countries. Against this backdrop, this paper explores the growing importance of BRICS countries as contributors to the global economy and to global governance. Using NDB as a case-study, the paper explores the origins of the Bank and attempts to answer why a new institution was needed, elaborating on five practical examples in which NDB could contribute with innovations to the modus operandi of multilateral development banking. The authors argue that out of all multilateral development banks created in the past decades, the NDB has the largest potential to catalyze changes in the Bretton Woods institutions and to grow as an alternative to them.

AB The objective of this study is to examine the impact of international research and development (R&D) spillovers on innovation efficiency of specific R&D outcomes, employing the country-level panel data for 44 countries in the 1996-2013 period. Fully considering the heterogeneity of different R&D outputs, scientific papers, PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) patents, US patents, and domestic patents are observed separately, which enriches the angles of measuring international R&D spillovers. By applying a stochastic frontier analysis to knowledge production function, we find that foreign R&D capital stock positively contributes to the innovation efficiency of scientific papers, but suppresses the productivity of domestic patents, whereas it does not really matter for PCT or US patents. These results are robust to control for a set of institutional factors and also in sensitivity analyses. Hence, dependence on international R&D spillovers seems neither to be the right way for emerging economies to catch up, nor to be a sustainable model for developing countries to fill the technical gap. Local R&D capital stock, instead, keeps an essential contributor to all four R&D outputs, so raising internal R&D expenditure is actually the key to improving innovation level and sustainable development ability.

TI Reducing post-harvest food losses through innovative collaboration:
   Insights from the Colombian and Mexican avocado supply chains

AB Postharvest losses along food supply chains have far reaching consequences for the environment and affect the social and economic conditions of food supply chain participants, especially of those in developing countries. This paper explores the structural inefficiencies that lead to postharvest losses and analyses how innovative collaboration could lead to more sustainable food supply chains (FSCs) by reducing those inefficiencies. Innovative collaboration is defined as the improvement or creation of inter organizational relationships through which FSC participants can exchange information, align incentives, engage in effective partnerships and improve their use of technology. This research distinguishes two research questions: First, how do FSC participants interact and which structural inefficiencies leading to postharvest losses can be identified in global food supply chains? And second, what are the main drivers and barriers of FSC participants to engage in innovative collaboration to reduce postharvest losses within global food supply chains? Two case studies explore the supply chain of avocados, especially due to their high susceptibility to postharvest losses, and focus on avocados from Mexico and Colombia imported into the Netherlands. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with avocado importers, producers/exporters, packers and growers' associations, governmental organizations, and knowledge institutions. Informal interviews were held with producers and suppliers of other agricultural products traded globally. Using the software NVIVO, the collected data from interviews, documents and literature was structured allowing patterns and categories in the data to be discerned. The contribution of this paper is a typology of structural inefficiencies in global food supply chains, which provides insight into the social drivers of postharvest losses. Three categories of structural inefficiencies leading (directly or indirectly) to postharvest losses were identified: (1) corporate inefficiencies, (2) cognitive and affective inefficiencies, and (3) tangible inefficiencies. Effective partnerships were found to be the backbone of innovative collaboration, and the largest contributor to the reduction of postharvest losses, functioning as catalysts of trust, communication, cooperation and innovation, in addition to contributing to reduce structural inefficiencies along food supply chains.

TI Factors influencing performance by contracted non-state providers
   implementing a basic package of health services in Afghanistan
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Contracting out; Non-state providers; Afghanistan
ID FRAGILE STATES; CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES; BALANCED SCORECARD; SYSTEM;
   DELIVERY; PROGRESS; SECTOR; CARE
AB Background: In 2002 Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and its development partners initiated a new paradigm for the health sector by electing to Contract-Out (CO) the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) to non-state providers (NSPs). This model is generally regarded as successful, but literature is scarce that examines the motivations underlying implementation and factors influencing program success. This paper uses relevant theories and qualitative data to describe how and why contracting out delivery of primary health care services to NSPs has been effective. The main aim of this study was to assess the contextual, institutional, and contractual factors that influenced the performance of NSPs delivering the BPHS in Afghanistan.
   Methods: The qualitative study design involved individual in-depth interviews and focus group discussions conducted in six provinces of Afghanistan, as well as a desk review. The framework for assessing key factors of the contracting mechanism proposed by Liu et al. was utilized in the design, data collection and data analysis.
   Results: While some contextual factors facilitated the CO (e.g. MoPH leadership, NSP innovation and community participation), harsh geography, political interference and insecurity in some provinces had negative effects. Contractual factors, such as effective input and output management, guided health service delivery. Institutional factors were important; management capacity of contracted NSPs affects their ability to deliver outcomes. Effective human resources and pharmaceutical management were notable elements that contributed to the successful delivery of the BPHS. The contextual, contractual and institutional factors interacted with each other.
   Conclusion: Three sets of factors influenced the implementation of the BPHS: contextual, contractual and institutional. The MoPH should consider all of these factors when contracting out the BPHS and other functions to NSPs. Other fragile states and countries emerging from a period of conflict could learn from Afghanistan's example in contracting out primary health care services, keeping in mind that generic or universal contracting policies might not work in all geographical areas within a country or between countries.

SO HUMAN RESOURCES FOR HEALTH

   OPPORTUNITIES; SYSTEMS; COSTS
AB Context and background: People and health systems worldwide face serious challenges due to shifting disease demographics, rising population demands and weaknesses in healthcare provision, including capacity shortages and lack of impact of healthcare services. These multiple challenges, linked with the global push to achieve universal health coverage, have made apparent the importance of investing in workforce development to improve population health and economic well-being. In relation to medicines, health systems face challenges in terms of access to needed medicines, optimising medicines use and reducing risk. In 2017, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) published global policy on workforce development ('the Nanjing Statements') that describe an envisioned future for professional education and training. The documents make clear that expanding the pharmacy workforce benefits patients, and continually improving education and training produces better clinical outcomes.
   Aims and purpose: The opportunities for harnessing new technologies in pharmacy practice have been relatively ignored. This paper presents a conceptual framework for analysing production methods, productivity and technology in pharmacy practice that differentiates between dispensing and pharmaceutical care services. We outline a framework that may be employed to study the relationship between pharmacy practice and productivity, shaped by educational and technological inputs.
   Method and results: The analysis is performed from the point of view of health systems economics. In relation to pharmaceutical care (patient-oriented practice), pharmacists are service providers; however, their primary purpose is not to deliver consultations, but to maximise the quantum of health gain they secure. Our analysis demonstrates that ` technology shock' is clearly beneficial compared with orthodox notions of productivity or incremental gain implementations. Additionally, the whole process of providing professional services using ` pharmaceutical care technologies' is governed by local institutional frames, suggesting that activities may be structured differently in different places and countries. Discussion and
   Conclusion: Addressing problems with medication use with the development of a pharmaceutical workforce that is sufficient in quantity and competence is a long-term issue. As a result of this analysis, there emerges a challenge about the profession's relationship with existing and emerging technical innovations. Our novel framework is designed to facilitate policy, education and research by providing an analytical approach to service delivery. By using this approach, the profession could develop examples of good practice in both developed and developing countries worldwide.

AB The revolution in technology has led to new approaches toward open and distance learning, particularly in the form of e-learning. E-learning governs the system of modern education by using Information and Communication Technology (ICT). There are different design approaches and interpretations of e-learning, primarily involving variations in instructional strategies and pedagogical models employed with the technology. These innovations offer compelling opportunities to educational institutions, students and faculty alike, yet they have also posed formidable challenges for e-learning. This is especially the case in the developing countries. This paper engages the concept and aims of e-learning with regard to the issues in the developing countries. The next part of the paper presents the need of e-learning in Pakistan and describes the major institutes offering e-learning and distance education as an alternate mode of education. The paper also elaborates major challenges of e-learning and explores the influencing factors for the adoption of e-learning in Pakistan. The important factors are investigated in terms of available ICT infrastructure and other country specific parameters. The paper also presents results of a survey that was conducted to evaluate students' preferences regarding e-learning. The survey result demonstrates a strong preference for e-learning by the students. The paper concludes by presenting a generalized model of e-learning that can fulfill the needs of leaners under available technology infrastructure.

AB This article aims to examine the main factors that may hinder or facilitate the adoption of cloud computing (CC) services by higher educational institutions in developing countries, exemplified here by Oman. A conceptual model was developed through extending the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework. Data was collected from 387 IT decision makers working in four higher educational institutions in Oman using a cross-sectional survey. Data was analysed using structural equation modelling based on AMOS 22.0. The results show that behavioural intention (BI) towards adopting CC services in higher educational institutions was influenced by top management support, relative advantage, attitudes towards change, technology readiness, complexity, government regulation, peer pressure, and data concerns in their order of influencing power. These all together accounted for 58.3% of the variance in BI. However, compatibility, vendor lock-in and external expertise did not have an influence on BI. This research provides original insight for cloud computing adoption within Oman from a managerial and IT professional perspectives. Specifically, this research would be helpful for government agencies, cloud computing providers and policy makers at higher educational institutions. It will also explain the relatively low penetration rate of cloud computing services at present, which will help in formulating strategies to encourage the adoption and acceptance of CC services by Omani higher educational institutions, where CC is still considered an innovation.

AB Despite the recognition that farmers are an important source of agricultural innovations, farmer-generated innovations have received little attention from researchers. This paper presents the experiences and outcomes of applying contests to elicit farmer-generated innovations and to reward outstanding farmer innovators in selected districts in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and Zambia. The contests attracted 349 eligible entries, most of which were submitted by male innovators. The identified innovations were mainly technically-oriented practices, and only very few institutional innovations were recognized. The most common domains of innovations were related to livestock, crop management, and soil and water management. In particular, many of the innovators were using local resources to develop plant-based biopesticides and ethnoveterinary medicines in order to reduce production costs and improve food production. The findings of this study suggest that farmers are active experimenters who continuously generate remarkable and locally adapted innovations, which can indirectly contribute to efforts to achieve sustainable agricultural intensification or to make agriculture climate smart. The study concludes that farmers possess valuable ethnobotanical knowledge and innovation-generating potential that need to be harnessed and supported; and contest is an effective means to scout and acknowledge farmer innovators while simultaneously raising awareness of the farmer innovation approach among relevant stakeholders.

AB While the economic and environmental dimensions of the triple bottom line (TBL) have been covered extensively by management theory and practice, the social dimension remains largely underrepresented. The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the natural resource-based view (NRBV) of the firm are revisited to lay the theoretical foundation for exploring how the social dimension might be addressed. Social capabilities are then explored by looking at the social entrepreneurship literature and illustrative cases with the purpose of elaborating RBV toward a social resource-based view (SRBV) of the firm. Three illustrative cases, which represent social businesses located in catastrophe-ridden Haiti, show how capabilities are used to overcome challenging constraints. The goal for the social entrepreneur is to employ the appropriate capabilities to ensure economic success, a positive environmental impact, and social benefits that leave the local community in a better position than without the business. Just as NRBV is a previous elaboration of RBV, so can SRBV be an elaborated theoretical foundation for future research. The components of a theory are systematically addressed by extending the range of variables (adding social capabilities), extending the domain (including stakeholders with economic, environmental, and/or social stakes), and offering propositions on variable relationships and outcome predictions (linking social capabilities and shared TBL value creation). By highlighting the social capabilities of social entrepreneurs, this research illuminates the micro-foundations of corporate social responsibility, emphasizing the value of individual level analyses.

AB The overarching question tackled in this paper is: to what degree has financial development contributed to providing opportunities of human development for those on low-incomes and by which information technology mechanisms? We systematically review about 180 recently published papers to provide recent information technology advances in finance for inclusive development. Retained financial innovations are structured along three themes. They are: (i) the rural-urban divide, (ii) women empowerment and (iii) human capital in terms of skills and training The financial instruments are articulated with case studies, innovations and investment strategies with particular emphasis, inter alia on: informal finance, microfinance, mobile banking, crowdfunding, microinsurance, Islamic finance, remittances, Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and the Diaspora Investment in Agriculture (DIA) initiative.

AB Recent changes in the mining industry have opened new opportunities for technological upgrading by local suppliers in developing countries. This paper explores the factors that foster or hinder innovation in such a context. We employ a case study methodology to analyze a sample of Peruvian mining contractors that integrated into knowledge-intensive stages of the value chain in recent years. Our main findings reveal that technological efforts are largely driven by the mining companies' demands, which favor incumbent over emergent suppliers due to their experience in the local market. In order to integrate into the more knowledge intensive stages of the value chain, we identified that these firms followed two strategies: (i) identification of local-specific market niches where foreign competition is scarce, and (ii) partnerships with global suppliers and specialization in high-quality and customized complementary services. Still, all the suppliers in the sample are very new in technologically complex activities, and their innovations remain limited from a global perspective. Our findings suggest that this is partly due to a weak institutional setting, scarce support from external organizations, and limited coordination channels in the sector.

AB The study of issues, related to the innovative processes in the developing countries of the world is one of the most important and popular areas of modern economic science. The scope and country specificity of innovative processes make it possible to identify the most effective models of national innovation development. Consideration of the scope, structure and dynamics of the performance of research and development activities (R & D) is the main tool for the assessment of innovation process development in the country. The object of this study is the scope and specificity of innovation process in modern China. The subject of the study is the scope and structure of research and development activities, seen through the perspective of innovative development of national economy. The purpose of given research is to study the scope and specificity of modern innovation processes in China, through the consideration of the main indicators of development of scientific and research field in China. The methodological basis of the article is the general provisions of modern economic science, in particular: modern macroeconomic theory, the theory of the world economy development, the concept of innovative development, the theory of human capital, general theory of adaptation, applied through the system analysis. According to the data on R & D financing, the authors define China's place in the global process of investment in innovations; they give and analyse extensive statistical data, characterizing the resource intensity and the results of R & D in this country. This analysis is carried out in the institutional context: the indicators of development of scientific-research sphere, scientific-educational sphere and business component of R & D are considered separately.

AB Purpose: We examined the effects of a community outreach program for maternal health in Tigray, Ethiopia, on women's knowledge about pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum care, and family planning, and assessed their participation in antenatal care, postpartum checkups, institutional childbirth, and contraceptive use.
   Methods: We recruited Ethiopian women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) in Tigray, Ethiopia. Two villages in Tigray, Kihen and Mesanu, which have similar population sizes and living environments, were chosen as the intervention and comparison groups, respectively. A two-group pretest-posttest design with cluster sampling was employed. We conducted self-report questionnaire surveys using face-to-face interviews. The 2.5-year community outreach program was developed based on Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory. It consisted of mass media use and health education for lay women in the community, along with training of health care providers, including nurses, midwives, and health extension workers, in maternal health care.
   Results: The intervention group showed significant increases in knowledge and behaviors regarding maternal health and family planning compared to the comparison group (p < .001). In particular, there was a dramatic increase from 10.8% to 93.5% in the institutional birth rate in the intervention group.
   Conclusion: The community outreach program and health care professional training effectively improved knowledge and behaviors regarding maternal health in Ethiopian women. Mass media and interpersonal communication channels for health education may be useful health interventions in developing countries.

AB The impact of regulatory coercion on firm environmental responsiveness is well discussed by institutional theorists. The intuitive nature of the relationship is positive and monotonic, that is, the continuous strengthening of regulatory coercion prompts top management to be more environmentally responsive. This paper shows that: (1) overall, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between regulatory coercion and firm environmental responsiveness, that is, the continuous strengthening of regulatory coercion induces top management to bring their firms' environmental responsiveness up to a certain optimum level beyond which its ability to trigger more proactive and substantive environmental responsiveness begins to decelerate, while reactive and symbolic strategic conformity accelerates; (2) perceived institutional (mis)alignment moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship between regulatory coercion and firm environmental responsiveness. Finally, results show that the moderated inverted U-shaped hypothesis advances the long-standing and contentious debate about the relationship between regulatory coercion and firm environmental responsiveness.

AB Intellectual property rights are a key piece of the expanded trade agenda, and the United States has pushed hard to strengthen protections beyond WTO standards in its trade agreements. While agreement provisions governing intellectual property are commonly thought to be an important driver of corporate preferences over US trade policy, systematic empirical evidence for this proposition, especially in comparison to other determinants of trade policy, is generally lacking. To fill this void, this paper examines variation in reliance on intellectual property across US industries to explain attitudes and lobbying on US trade agreements. The effects of IP provisions on support for US trade agreements are politically substantial, though trade remains the primary determinant of preferences over trade agreements.

AB This article examines the impact of policies for start-up and entrepreneurship on the developmental model that remains a policy legacy in many Asian countries. The main argument is that the influence of central planning is deeply embedded in the institutions of the Four Asian Tigers, but globalisation and economic liberalisation are disrupting the old developmentalism by incentivising innovation and structural adaptability. In practice, although developmentalism once focused on infrastructure and industrial policy, softer strategies such as attracting educated millennials through urban amenities and creative clustering mimic those of the postindustrial West. Either this trend represents the end of developmentalism or top-down industrial policy is being rebranded to embrace knowledge and service industries. This article examines this issue at the urban scale, examining policies used by Singapore and Seoul to encourage start-ups and entrepreneurship in the context of innovation. Government documents are examined and findings compared.

AB In Sub-Saharan Africa, women's farm labor is highest in Ethiopia. Using focus group discussions with 240 farmers and other research tools, our USAID-funded Feed the Future Innovation for the Reduction of Post-Harvest Loss-Ethiopia study explores the sources of (dis)empowerment of rural farmers in Ethiopia. We find that women are disempowered across all five domains of empowerment due to cultural factors, despite government and financial institution policy changes. Women with low education tend to engage in low risk/return farming practices, including growing less nutritious crops, thereby undermining nutritional security of the household. Our findings confirm that women's role increases to as much as 80 percent in post-harvest. Poor storage technologies resulting in fungal/pest infections and chemicals in stored grains pose serious health risks for women, and poor women consume grains with up to 50 percent damage. Food security and development policies should empower women and promote improved technologies-particularly targeting women-to reduce grain losses and women's work burden while mitigating health risks.

FX The Ethiopia PHLIL team of Mekelle University acknowledges the financial
   and professional support of USAID and Kansas State University without
   which this study's survey and other tools would have never come into
   fruition. PHLIL Ethiopia team also is greatly indebted for the
   logistical and facilitation support of Mekelle University and partners
   in the four survey regions. Moreover, we reserve special thanks for the
   local administration units and their experts for mobilizing and
   organizing farmer groups for the survey FGDs. We are also thankful to
   Ato Minilik Kefale (Amhara ISSD), W/o Meseret Getaneh, W/o Simret
   Semano, (SNNP ISSD) Muez Berhe (Humera ARC and SBN), Rahwa Gebre
   (Mekelle University), and Kulumsa ARC for their committed work during
   the two rounds of data collection. We give a special thanks to the
   farmers who participated in the study for their information, trust, and
   cooperation. We thank Dr. Atsushi Nara (Department of Geography, San
   Diego State University) for creating our Figure 1 map. Research reported
   here was made possible by the generous support of the American people
   through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
   under the Feed the Future initiative (www.feedthefuture.gov). The

AB This paper analyses intermediary organisations in developing economy agricultural clusters. The paper critically engages with a growing narrative in studies of intermediaries that have stressed the ownership structure of intermediaries as a key driver for enabling knowledge transfer, inter-firm learning and upgrading of small producers in clusters. Two case studies of Latin American clusters are presented and discussed. The study suggests that in addition to ownership structure, cluster governance and the embeddedness of intermediaries in clusters are critical factors that need to be taken into account in understanding the influence of intermediaries in the upgrading of small producers in clusters.

AB This article criticizes the resource curse thesis for neglecting the interplay of international factors and domestic politics, that is the political settlement, in explaining industrial performance in a resource-dependent society - Trinidad and Tobago. Using political settlement, analysis secondary as well as interview data, it examines the dynamics at the macro and sectoral levels in iron and steel and telecommunications in Trinidad and Tobago. The historical evidence reveals that anti-colonial mobilizations spurred critical public investments in developmental institutions and industrial projects responsible for improving the country's productive base and technological capability in the post- Black Power period. These investments were bolstered by a favorable geopolitical climate and the 1973 commodity boom. Sectoral case studies reveal how shifts in the country's political settlement affected late-industrializing accumulation of accumulation technological capabilities. Hereafter neoliberal policies facilitated an increased role for external actors in economic policy and ethnic-based clientelism within the political economy.

AB In a context of a severe funding crisis, donors and policymakers expect increased accountability from research organizations and convincing proof that public investments in research have significant and positive societal impacts. This article takes stock of the lessons learned from the use of a method (ImpresS) designed by CIRAD to analyze the impact of research undertaken in partnership with a range of different actors in a developing-country context. The method uses a case study approach, and relies on the evaluation of the impact pathway and on contribution analysis. Thirteen case studies were selected to represent the diversity of partnerships, research activities and types of innovation. The results confirm the diversity and complexity of the innovation processes encompassing the non-linearity of changes over extended periods, the diversity of impacts, the shifting roles of actors engaged in the innovation process, and the diversity of activities carried out by the research community to contribute to outcome and impact generation. Interactions between researchers and other actors throughout the innovation process appeared to play key roles along the impact pathway. Based on the 13 case studies, we identified four generic models through which research contributes to impact: participatory transfer of knowledge and technologies, co-design of innovation, support for the innovation process, and promotion of open innovation. Our results underline the need for research institutions to recognize and accept the diversity of functions fulfilled by researchers if they want to contribute in an effective manner to the generation of impacts. Another challenge is to learn how to take advantage of clusters of projects embedded in innovation pathways in order to sustain research activities over a long timeframe.
   Significance statement Impact evaluation is increasingly being requested from the research community as a measure of accountability by both donors and civil society. Conducting it properly is challenging, especially in the context of developing countries. Quantitative studies are often biased toward expected and tangible impacts. Complementary qualitative approaches are focused on understanding causality and are more in line with the actors' participation in impact evaluation. CIRAD has developed a method and used it to assess 13 case studies involving research conducted in partnership in widely differing environments. Some main lessons learned include the long timeframe needed for impacts to be achieved, the diversity of impacts the research community needs to consider, and the multiple roles played by the research community in co-developing outcomes with diverse stakeholders. Results show that the research community can contribute to impacts by using several models of intervention.

AB The article synthesises the experiences of innovation platforms (IPs) that engaged in open-ended experimental action to improve the institutional context for smallholder farm development in West Africa. The IPs sought change at the level of the institutional regime covering an entire agricultural domain (such as cocoa, cotton, oil palm or water management). Their purpose was therefore not to 'roll out' farm-level technologies across rural communities. The IPs's outcomes were documented and analysed throughout by means of theory-based process tracing in each of seven of the nine domains in which regime change was attempted. The evidence shows that by means of exploratory scoping and diagnosis, socio-technical and institutional experimentation, and guided facilitation IPs can remove, by-pass, or modify domain-specific institutional constraints and/or create new institutional conditions that allow smallholders to capture opportunity. The article describes the 5-year, 4.5 million research programme in Benin, Ghana and Mali, covering theory, design, methods and results. It is the sequel to Hounkonnou et al. in AGSY 108 (2012): 74-83. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Integrated Agricultural Research for Development (IAR4D) is a mode of participatory action research for development that aims to improve the well-being of smallholder farming households by facilitating networks between farmers and marketplace actors through groups called 'innovation platforms'. In 2012, the Association for the Promotion of Livestock in the Sahel and Savannas (APESS, an NGO with rural membership) established nine innovation platforms in the Sahelian zone in Senegal, Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Chad, with the aim of engaging member livestock producers with meat and milk processors and traders. In late 2013 and early 2014, each innovation platform reviewed its perception of "performance" or "functionality", using a consensus-based group assessment scored against nine criteria. The aim of this study is to test the extent to which perceived functionality was related to the activities of the innovation platform, as well as current farm productivity and profitability, household well-being, and regional context, using data gathered independently by APESS as part of its broader mandate to improve the lives of members.
   Across the nine innovation platforms, there were strong positive correlations between the responses to all self assessment criteria i.e. members perceived that their innovation platform was performing strongly or weakly in all respects. The criterion scores were correlated positively with the number of meetings held, but not with numbers or gender of attendees, training opportunities, nor actions agreed at meetings. Innovation platforms self-assessed more positively in southern, higher rainfall regions than in the northern, lower rainfall regions. Performance was positively correlated with many measures of farm productivity and household well-being, including median area of farms, value of crop and hay production, sales of animals or animal products, expenditure on agricultural inputs, current engagement with markets, and estimated number of months per year that the family is able to feed itself.
   We conclude that the IAR4D approach is perceived to work well in high rainfall zones, for smallholders with a relatively high current level of well-being, who have larger and more productive farms, and who are already engaged with markets. The approach does not appear to work well in more arid regions for poorer smallholders, who are often not able to provide food for their families for 12 months of every year. The IAR4D focus on social networking into markets appears to be relevant for producers who wish to strengthen or diversify existing market relationships, but is not perceived to be sufficiently relevant by smallholders for whom achieving reliable subsistence and averting starvation remains the priority.

TI Transfer of development rights as an institutional innovation to address
   issues of property rights
SO JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT

   property rights; Urban planning; Conservation and urban renewal

AB Many densely populated cities face the issues of limited usable urban land, and the redevelopment process may threaten the built heritage. Government, in serving the public interest, often intervenes through administrative or regulatory means in the conservation of these privately owned heritage buildings during urban renewal, even though such intervention may violate private property rights to different degrees. Yet, the general law of most developed and developing countries, though in different forms, is meant to protect private property rights. So, it is important to devise a fair and workable mechanism, supported with an innovative institutional arrangement, to control development of privately owned properties. Transfer of development rights (TDR) is one institutional innovation that can balance the conflict between public and private interests to supplement the defect of planning law. Before using TDR to address the property rights issues, there are some concerns that need debating. These include: whether development rights are property rights or not; the impact of conservation on property value; and the role of TDR on property rights, compensation or mitigation of the affected property. This research study begins by analyzing the relationship between property rights and development rights, and exploring how property rights, planning law and TDR interact with each other. It then takes Hong Kong as a typical example among the dense cities to examine the TDR programmes for built heritage conservation and identify the challenges of TDR. Due to the institutional-based characteristics of TDR, the research utilizes a comparison of TDR in Hong Kong with those in other jurisdictions from the perspective of property rights to extend the research result to wider application. The most recent controversial court case in Hong Kong (the 'Hysan' case) is discussed to illustrate the intricacy and controversy evolving around this issue. Finally, the research proposes strategies for the improvement in TDR, based on Hong Kong and overseas experiences from the perspective of legislative amendments, protection of property rights and of other stakeholders' rights.

AB This study examined the non-linear relationship between financial development and innovation using generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators for a panel data model. The sample comprised data for 75 developed and developing countries for the period 1996 to 2010. An inverted U-shaped non-linear relationship between finance and innovation was observed. This finding implies that finance enhances innovation only up to a certain level. Beyond that level, further development of finance tends to affect innovation adversely. The institution interaction term was included to examine its role in the relationship between finance and innovation. The results suggest that the finance-innovation curve varies with different settings of institutional quality. Specifically, the finance-innovation relationships followed an inverted U curve only for countries with high institutional quality. Hence, sound institutional quality is a prerequisite for financial development to benefit innovation. (C) 2017 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB Using unique innovation survey data collected from a homogenous sample of firms in Pakistan, this paper presents an analysis of the firm level determinants of product innovation and its impact on firm performance. We employ a multi-stage structural model linking the decision of a firm to innovate, its innovation investment, product innovation, and firm performance using primary data from the textile and wearing apparel sector, which is the largest export sector of Pakistan. We find that product innovation leads to increased labor productivity as well as higher labor productivity growth. A 10 percent increase in innovative sales per worker is associated with a greater than 10 percent increase in labor productivity and labor productivity growth. On the determinants of innovation, we find that vertical knowledge flows from foreign clients and suppliers are important determinants of a firm's decision to innovate. Larger firms are more likely to engage in innovation, however, there is no significant evidence that they invest more in innovation. Exporting is positively associated with innovation performance and firms exporting to Europe and America are more likely to engage in innovation. There is mixed evidence on the impact of competition: foreign competition adversely affects a firm's decision to innovate, whereas, local competition increases investment in innovation. Subsidies seem to have a crowding out effect since firms receiving national subsides invest less in innovation. Furthermore, firms that have higher investment in innovation, that are more productive, and that introduce organizational innovations have higher innovative sales per worker.

AB Potentially, technology transfer offices (TTOs) can play a significant role in facilitating the successful transfer of technologies and knowledge between universities and industry. Many developing countries are currently developing technology transfer practices within their universities. However, many developing country TTOs operate inefficiently or are ineffective. The sharing of experiences can lead to improvements in this endeavour. Advanced nations can serve as a frame of reference and a basis of policy recommendations for developing countries due to the longevity of their technology transfer activities. The authors issued 234 questionnaires to European university TTOs, of which 54 usable questionnaires were returned. They combine the data from these questionnaires with 19 interviews conducted with university TTO staff from 9 countries in an attempt to create a typology of practices that developing nations could emulate to improve technology transfer in their own contexts. While ultimately a clear typology was not forthcoming, the authors found some relationship between the dominant focus in the mission statement of developed country TTOs, the activities they undertake, their position in the university governance structure and their level of maturity which may usefully inform the development of TTO practices in developing countries.

AB In the wake of the global financial crisis that resulted in many business closures and given the long-term problem of population aging in advanced countries and poverty in low-income countries, it has become important to investigate whether new business formation by women entrepreneurs is a path to prosperity even when countries experience low fertility rates. Existing country studies suggest that female entrepreneurship can have favorable development outcomes through the channels of employment, innovation and welfare, but this paper undertakes a holistic cross-country analysis on the determinants of female entrepreneurship, exploring the role of fertility rates in affecting female entrepreneurial outcomes. We find that the impact of fertility rate is negative and significant in influencing entrepreneurship. But factors like greater tertiary enrollment of females and higher ratios of female to male labor force participation rates can offset the negative impact of fertility rate and in fact can make the impact positive. Additionally, greater access to informal finance makes female enrollment more effective in mitigating the negative impact of fertility rate.

AB Given the growing interest in the ability of the private sector to contribute to the goal of providing universal access to energy in developing countries, this study sets out to investigate the practices and business approaches of private actors in the emerging niche of private mini-grid development in Kenya. The paper's analytical focus is on how niche actors are influencing and creating change in the incumbent electrification regime of grid extension to strengthen and expand the niche for private mini-grids. The analysis shows that, in addition to internal niche processes like the alignment of expectations, learning and network building, niche actors actively engage in various forms of institutional work. The greatest emphasis here is on regulatory institutional work in order to influence legal and economic frameworks, but niche actors also engage in cognitive institutional work to enhance acceptance of the niche technology by constructing a shared world view between niche and regime actors. Interestingly, niche actors also engage in normative work to establish positive normative associations with the private-sector model, like equity and social justice. The research concludes that in this case institutional work is collective work drawing on different mandates and relying on different skills and resources.

AB The paper provides a theoretical model of technology adoption based on the idea that the diffusion of information about a technology depends both on the social structure of the adopters and their degree of assortativity. We propose a framework that - while retaining the core assumptions of epidemic diffusion models allows for explicit modelling of the social structure via social network and of agents cultural heterogeneity via agent-based simulation. Decision-making takes place in institutional contexts where individual features trigger differentiated imitative responses and societal organization acts as medium on which information flows. The model simulates the diffusion of fertilizers in five Ethiopian villages (Peasant Associations), which differ in both political and relational structures and farmers belong to numerous ethnic and religious groups. Starting from survey data we run a compositional understanding simulation with the aim of reproducing observed diffusion curves on the basis of unobserved individual interactions. By minimizing the divergence from model output and observed diffusion, the exercise of categorical calibration and time series fit identify a set of plausible parameters for each village. Results highlight the importance of cultural dissimilarities to understand the diffusion processes.

AB Limited evidence exists on the a priori feasibility of implementing ecosystem services (ES) governance arrangements, to simultaneously ensure nature conservation, human wellbeing, and equity. Using a multiscale institutional approach, we explore rules, property rights, and stakeholders' values and the extent to which such institutions may entail or prevent governance innovations around ES. We focus on water supply and a Southern municipality of Chile as an apt illustration. Results show that the concept of ES and ES mechanisms are exempt from formal norms (e.g., national laws). The formal institutional setting is generally weak with respect to nature conservation and a fragmented view prevails, where the management of land, water, forests and protected areas is separately handled by a myriad of agencies. The presence of highly concentrated water rights may impair benefits appropriability by ES beneficiaries, as long as any potential buyer can acquire water rights. Furthermore, incompatible values regarding nature create tensions across different stakeholders, particularly between hydroelectricity companies and indigenous communities. In this scenario of multiple rationalities, moving towards ES-based environmental governance seems problematic. In light of the evidence, it is clear that the ES approach does not necessarily fit in every local reality and seems to face obstacles, such as achieving equity and justice, particularly in contexts wherein local and indigenous knowledge systems have not been adequately considered by states within their institutional arrangements.

AB City governments in sub-Saharan Africa have historically been beholden to national governments. Lack of national urban policies and tensions between national and city governments are common. Yet, for decades, research has identified small-scale innovations at the urban scale. Rarely, however, are policy innovations in African cities so influential as to lead national governments to scale up city based actions. This is particularly true in sectors that have been the dominant purview of central governments. This paper examines how citizens, civil society organizations, city governments and national bureaucrats in two cities of East Africa - Kampala and Nairobi - have interacted to produce policy innovation in agriculture. Agriculture has always been a sector of high national importance in Africa, but increasingly cities are becoming focal points for agricultural policy change. The two cities compared in the paper are unusual in having a collection of interests who have been advocating for improved support and recognition of urban food production. Indeed, these cities are rare for having continually promoted the formalization of urban agriculture in local and national policy. While advocacy for urban agriculture is common globally, what is not clear is under what conditions local advocacy produces policy uptake and change. What are the conditions when city-based advocacy deepens the institutionalization of policy support locally and nationally? Drawing from theory and research on policy change and African urban politics and governance, and qualitative data collection in each country, this paper argues that while external, international assistance has helped initiate policy dialogue, domestic civil society organizations and their engagement with local and national bureaucrats are key to policy support at the local and national scales.

AB Climate-related adaptation practices are often conscious policy decisions initiated from outside a community by governments, development agencies, or other actors. Whereas expectations that such adaptation strategies would positively interact with local priorities to support action, adaptive actions at one scale might also constrain actions at other scales depending on the context. Yet, limited empirical evidence exists on the tensions, or, in the best case, synergies between adaptation practices that cross spatial scales, policy arenas, and jurisdictional boundaries. Drawing on a longitudinal study conducted in agropastoral communities in Burkina Faso, I examined how higher scale agricultural adaptation actions initiated by government and international organizations were re-defined when implemented locally. The findings illuminate a discrepancy between the aims of (a) higher scale adaptation practices and (b) the strategies pursued by local agropastoralists. While higher scale initiatives, promoted since the great droughts hit the region in the 1970s and 1980s, remained technical in nature and aimed to boost agricultural food production, local strategies were primarily pursued to secure off-farm income and animal fodder. Efforts to advance adaptation across scales will necessitate better attention to local contexts such as off-farm activities as integrated and viable ways of agropastoralists' agricultural' adaptation repertoire, and institutions, organizations, and local networks should move forward with collaborative processes, including local stakeholders from the outset, to develop broader adaptation plans than technological-only.

AB A transdisciplinary research approach requires that different scientists with their discipline-specific theories, concepts and methods find ways to work together with other societal players to address a real-life problem. In this study, the push-pull technology (PPT) was used as a boundary object to enable interactions among stakeholders across science-practice boundaries engaged in the control of stemborer pest in maize crops in Bako Tibe, Jimma Arjo and YayuWoredas in Ethiopia between August 2014 and April 2015. The PPT is a biological mechanism developed by researchers for the control of stemborer pests and Striga weed in maize crop. It involves inter-cropping maize with a stemborer moth-repellent silverleaf or greenleaf Desmodium (push), and planting an attractive trap crop, Napier or Brachiaria grass (pull), around it. The on-farm implementation of PPT was used to provide an opportunity for collaboration, interaction and learning among stakeholders including researchers from the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research and practitioners from the Ministry of Agriculture and smallholder farmers/traders. The research was implemented following the transdisciplinary action research and the data collected using mixed methods approach, including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, workshops, on-farm practical demonstrations and participant observations. The findings show that collaborative leadership provides a chance for the stakeholders to participate in the technology learning and decision making, by enabling them to jointly contribute skills towards development, refinement and adaptation of the PPT. In situations where there are conflicts, they are embraced and converted to opportunities for in-depth learning, finding solutions and adaptation of the innovation processes rather than being sources of contradictions or misunderstandings. The leadership roles of the farmers enabled them to reflect on their own practices and draw on scientific explanations from researchers. It also enabled them to take the lead in new technology implementation and information sharing with fellow farmers and other stakeholders in a free and easy manner. Although the perennial nature of the companion crops in the PPT provides opportunities for continuous stakeholder interaction and learning, it requires a personally committed leadership and formal institutional engagements for the sustainability of the activities, which span several cropping seasons. Market forces and the involvement of the private sector also play a role as shown from the involvement of individual farmers and traders in Desmodium and Brachiaria seed production, collection and distribution during the PPT implementation.

AB This paper studies features of grassroots ecopreneurs' leadership in their attempt to ignite transformations in production-consumption systems from the bottom up. It builds on a comprehensive approach of change agency based on institutional work, innovation, and learning intermediation literature. The paper describes grassroots ecopreneurs' interaction strategies to resource business models for sustainability. Empirical data comes from an action research project that consisted of implementing a sustainability experiment in Sur de Bolivar (Colombia). The experiment shows grassroots ecopreneurs' arrays of activities around making sense, shaping, securing support, nurturing, expanding, and scaling the value proposition, the business infrastructure, the customer interface and the financial model of their ventures. Our findings suggest that leading businesses transition into a more sustainable field requires grassroots ecopreneurs acting as change agents by performing a diverse array of boundary, practice, and knowledge circulation strategies, aiming at securing the societal and environmental impact of their ventures. Change agency manifests in the ways ecopreneurs maneuver to bring about transformations and strive to sustain it. The study contributes to a better understanding of processes of socio-technical change for sustainability in highly diverse institutional contexts, such as (but not exclusively) the developing world. An agency-based approach is proposed as an alternative to a managerial approach.

AB The importance of sustainable innovation achievement propels firms to consider the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. However, it is important to clarify that not all innovations impact sustainable development. Regardless of the limited circumstances in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), intrapreneurship, stakeholder integration, and absorptive capacity are firm-specific capabilities that could be explored as strategic intentions of management practices in the organization. This paper investigated the mediating role of process innovation in the relationship among the firm-specific capabilities of absorptive capacity, intrapreneurship, and stakeholder integration for sustainable innovation in SMEs. This empirical study examines the manufacturing sector of Indonesian SMEs with a sample size of 190 firms. The study found that practices of process innovation, as a mediator triggered by the firm-specific capabilities of absorptive capacity, intrapreneurship, and stakeholder integration affect sustainable innovation, although at low stages. Finally, implications for the theory and practice of attaining sustainable innovation in SMEs are drawn.

AB Many theories of development traps rely on coordination failures. In this paper we develop a theory of incentive traps in organizations, which demonstrates how the provision of incentives may itself become reinforcing for the emergence of traps. Our theory marks the dynamic interplay between incentives and performance in teams where peer-effects are present, the returns to which accrue far beyond the career horizon of current cohort of agents, while taking into account both intergenerational learning dynamics and the existence of markets for talent. The theory may help explain why high-quality research is rewarded less in those institutions where it is mostly scarce, why relative wages of professors in some developing countries are significantly lower than in developed economies, or why governments expenditure on education as percent of GDP is substantially lower in LDCs as compared to developed economies.

AB The extent to which innovation can contribute to improving the livelihoods of marginalised communities in informal settings is greatly influenced by the social spaces' created for interactive learning and problem-solving, i.e. interactive learning spaces. This paper addresses an important issue: How do different models of inclusion influence the outcomes of innovation capacity-building interventions? With the use of a network-institutional approach, the paper analyses and compares two projectsin South Africa and Malawiaimed at improving the livelihoods of small-scale farmers through introducing new farming practices and organisational arrangements. The research raises important questions for assessing the impact of innovation for inclusive development. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB With the recent decline of renewable energy technology costs-most notably solar photovoltaics -off-grid energy systems are becoming increasingly attractive alternatives to grid extension for advancing rural electrification in Africa. However, there are institutional challenges to wider adoption of off-grid solutions. Combining a multi-level perspective with project funding data from the Kenyan and Tanzanian energy sectors, we assess the extent to which these new off-grid technologies have been incorporated into the existing energy regimes in both countries. Using a qualitative assessment of academic literature and official documents, and a quantitative assessment of energy investments, we find that although international development agencies have provided financial support for niche, off-grid companies, both global donors and the regime electricity sector operators in Kenya and Tanzania continue to favor on-grid and grid extension activities. While landscape influences on both countries are similar, we find that differences within the institutional regimes result in different development pathways for off-grid niches. In Kenya, unbundling and privatization efforts have attracted private investment in both on-and off-grid projects. Tanzania has more relaxed regulations for off-grid power producers, and a clearer regulatory framework for allowing off-grid operators to impose cost-reflective tariffs, which creates a supportive environment for niche innovation.

AB This paper examines determinants of process innovation introductions across 115 (mostly) developing countries. Empirical research on process innovations lags behind product innovations. Accounting for firm characteristics, R&D, regulations and taxes, and corruption, results show that sole proprietors and R&D-performing firms were more likely to introduce innovations, whereas greater prosperity made them less likely to do so. Corruption had a greasing effect, whereas firms in island nations were less likely to introduce, ceteris paribus. Effects of regulations and taxes and other firm characteristics were largely insignificant. Finally, some differences existed across manufacturing and service industries and across prevalence of innovation introductions.

ID CORRUPTION; FLIGHT; RISK
AB Economic growth has traditionally been attributed to the accumulation of human and physical capital and the increased productivity arising from technological innovation. The quest to attract physical capital led to the design and implementation of policies and the building of institutions by governments of developing countries to create a congenial investment environment to attract foreign investors. The multinational corporations operating in these developing countries take advantage of these policies to profit from these countries in terms of capital through both legal and fraudulent activities. For governments and stakeholders to be able to fight this menace of illicit financial outflow, there is a need for a comprehensive scrutiny of the quality of governance indicators that enhance the activities of these multinational companies. Therefore, this study seeks to explore the influence of cross-country indicators of governance on the illicit financial flow from developing countries. This study is based on secondary data (panel) derived from the Global Financial Integrity, World Development Indicators and Worldwide Governance Indicators. The total number of developing countries included in the analysis is 139, and 1562 observations are included. Using the multilevel estimation approach, the study finds that regulatory quality has a negative and significant influence on the illicit financial flow, while government effectiveness, corruption and FDI net inflows have a significant positive effect. This finding calls for developing countries to design and implement sound policies, build effective and accountable institutions, control corruption and enhance regulatory quality to control this issue.

TI A South African university's readiness assessment for bringing your own
   device for teaching and learning
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID BYOD
AB Background: The use of mobile devices for education is rapidly growing, and it is a global phenomenon. The trend of bringing personal mobile devices for learning using the institution's network to access data and other academic material is referred to as bring your own device (BYOD). Most universities in developed countries have implemented this phenomenon to enhance education. However, the rate of BYOD adoption in developing countries is lagging even though the majority of students and staff already own one or more mobile devices and are using them for personal and educational purposes.
   Objectives: The study determines the readiness of a South African university to adopt BYOD for teaching and learning. Moreover, the article presents the enabling factors and barriers of BYOD adoption within the university.
   Method: The study followed an interpretivist philosophical stance. A qualitative single-case study was used. Data were collected through questionnaires and thematic analysis was applied.
   Results: The BYOD readiness levels are low and are hampered both by organisational and technological factors. Key barriers include lack of comprehensive policies to govern the use of these devices, lack of infrastructure, limited top management support for innovations and security complexities, while the key enabling factors included accessibility to mobile technologies, ease of use, relative advantage and convenience.
   Conclusion: Bring your own device offers a suitable platform for mobile-learning (m-learning) in universities. Consideration of the readiness factors, such as adoption strategy, implementation plans, security and device management, skills development, and measures of discipline, is essential.

AB Background: Regardless of national contexts, the institutions responsible for research ethics, founded on international regulations, are all expected to be structured and to operate in a common way. Our experience with several countries on different continents, however, has raised questions in this regard. This article examines the differences and structural weaknesses of ethics committees in four countries (Burkina Faso, Palestine, Peru, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) where we have conducted the same socio-anthropological study in the field of reproductive health.
   Methods: In addition to recording our observations during field surveys for this study, we performed a documentary review and interviewed expert members of ethics committees, research participants, and researchers who had experience with requesting ethics approvals for research protocols in the field of social sciences and health.
   Results: The results of this study showed that, despite having the same mandate, the committees functioned differently, while they all exhibited the same weaknesses. Thus, the universalization and standardization of institutional conditions for applying ethical standards in research still present problems that are, at the very least, relevant.
   Conclusion: This study on ethics committees in four countries demonstrated the profound influence of context on the ways in which different institutions function and enforce regulations. In effect, in all social fields, every innovation is infused by its context.

TI An investigation on e-resource utilisation among university students in
   a developing country: A case of Great Zimbabwe University
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

   ADOPTION; FACULTY; STATE
AB Background: Electronic libraries are the recent development in the ever-changing technological world today. Students nowadays have the ability to carry the library wherever they are, their Internet-enabled devices being the only requirement. Most universities worldwide have subscribed to various online databases and other e-resources as a way of availing resources to their students. To their credit, most institutions of higher learning in developing countries have not been left out in this stampede.
   Objectives: The study aimed at investigating the adoption and utilisation of e-resources students at a university in a developing country.
   Method: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) model was used to conceptualise the study. A survey questionnaire was designed and distributed through social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp. Quantitative data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The Chi-squared test was used to test for casual relationships within the developed model. A thematic approach was used to analyse qualitative data.
   Results: Despite the fact that many Zimbabwean academic institutions have made the facility of e-libraries top agenda in their strategic plans, the adoption rate among students is still very limited. This can be attributed to a myriad of facts, inter alia, poor marketing strategies, lack of resources among the students and exorbitant data charges by Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
   Conclusion: This study has provided some basic insights in utilisation of e-resources in universities of developing countries. Despite the younger generation being described as digital natives, it is, quite evident that their uptake of technological innovations especially in education is quite poor. This research will assist both researchers and management of institutions of higher learning to provide and design amicable solutions to the problem of poor utilisation of e-resources as it highlights the major causes of poor utilisation in the developing country context.

AB Sustainability transitions literature is a rapidly growing and influential field of research. It argues for a radical change of systems providing human needs. Being triggered by the negative implications of the Western post-war model of development, major transition frameworks such as multilevel perspective, strategic niche management or transition management have been widely used to clarify and motivate socio-technical transformations in mainly more economically developed world. Because of their sustainability appeal, however, transition perspectives began to be applied in developing countries. This paper takes stock of and systematises the theoretical insights from this application. Using systematic review method of 115 publications released in the last decade, the paper discusses novel methodological and conceptual lessons around: experimentation and upscaling; stability, change and power; regime uniformity; contextual forces; path-dependence; transnadonal linkages; normative orientation and other aspects. Although the identified insights confirm the middle range character of the transition theory, they force some reflexivity and raise new research questions for both contexts. The paper also identifies a few policy implication for international organisations, donors, governments and civil society organisations.

AB Successful adoption of agricultural innovations depends not just on the right technology but also on markets, institutions, and policies. We illustrate this argument with four case studies of agricultural innovations in the semi-arid tropics, two with high and two with low adoption. We show that the success of both hybrid pearl millet in India and dual-purpose cowpea in Nigeria depended on identifying market demand correctly and on innovative institutions to overcome constraints in the production and delivery of improved seed. Conversely, the low adoption of improved varieties of pigeon pea in Malawi and conservation agriculture in Zimbabwe reflect uncertain market conditions, misunderstood demand and the lack of sustainable institutions for input delivery. The results highlight how variations in the enabling conditions may influence the fate of agricultural innovations.

AB Using novel data from micro, small and medium firms in Vietnam, we estimate the relationship between behavioural and personality traits of owners/managers - risk attitudes, locus of control, and innovativeness - and firm-level decisions. We extend the analysis beyond standard metrics of firm performance such as revenue and growth to study intermediate investments, including product innovation, worker training, and adoption of work-place safety measures that are potentially conducive to observed firm performance. Our results show that innovativeness and locus of control are positively correlated with revenue while risk aversion predicts lower revenue. Risk aversion is positively correlated with the adoption of safety measures. Innovativeness, as expected, is associated with an increased probability of product innovations. An internal locus of control predicts higher probability of investments, innovations and worker training. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that innovativeness and risk aversion matter more for firm outcomes in provinces characterized by better business climate. Our results are robust to a variety of checks. We contribute to a nascent and rapidly growing literature on the importance of managerial capital by shedding light on the role of managerial personality characteristics for decision-making in firms in a dynamic transition economy.

AB Uncertainty surrounding climate change has encouraged policy makers to engage in flexible and exploratory policies and forms of policy making. The article examines the potential of experimentation in devising coastal adaptation policies, taking into account its political dimensions. We analysed a multi-level experiment, funded by the French Ministry for the Environment from 2012 to 2015, where coastal municipalities volunteered to simulate the implementation of planned retreat as an adaptation strategy. Using insights from discursive institutionalism, we tracked developments throughout the experiment period. We highlight a combined process of governance experiment, allowing social innovation at local and regional scales, and a more strategic tool for the state, governing and steering local coastal policy with new instruments. We shed light on a particular policy entrepreneur (a public organization dealing with coastal management) playing at the intersection of these two forms, and in the interplay of policy scales. Although the experiment contributed to the innovation of legal and economic instruments and produced policy feedbacks in local planning and governance, learning capacities of the multi-scale architecture are still moderate to make planned retreat a reality in the near future. The conclusion considers performative and interpretive effects of policy experiments as further research questions to explore.

TI Co-creating an Open Government Action Plan: The Case of Sekondi-Takoradi
   Metropolitan Assembly, Ghana
SO GROWTH AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID OPEN INNOVATION; SERVICES
AB This paper contributes to the limited literature on open government initiatives at the subnational level in developing countries. It examines the motivations of actors in a local government authority to utilize the capabilities of various stakeholders to overcome constraints in cocreating an action plan for open government reforms. This empirical analysis utilized qualitative fieldwork conducted in Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolitan Assembly, Ghana's third largest local government. The findings demonstrate that a confluence of citizen demand for openness, and willingness within the governance stakeholders, are motivating the pursuit of open government reforms. Viewed through an open innovation framework, we argue that achieving good governance through information transparency, public participation, and accountability reforms is hindered by the institutional environment. Ghana's subnational governments need national level commitment to provide the resources, mandate, and authority to become truly open.

AB The transitions to sustainability approach has proved to be useful for academics, policy makers and practitioners to understand and promote socio-technical transformations, often aiming at climate change alternatives in European countries. However, little attention has been paid to the limitations of using frameworks such as the Multi-level perspective and the Strategic Niche Management approach in the developing world. Here, countries exhibit a mixture of well- and ill-functioning institutions, in a context of market imperfection, clientelist and social exclusive communities, patriarchal households and patrimonial and/or marketised states. In order to explore such limitations, we have used an institutional framework documented in the development studies literature, which describes three types of institutional settings: 'welfare', 'informal security' and 'insecurity'. This institutional analysis shows that (1) the context for innovation in developing countries is a loose scenario where the concepts of 'pockets' or 'layers' can be useful; (2) the characteristics of the institutional setting shape in several ways the quality of the niche structuration processes that create and unfold. Our rationale and illustrations call for bringing the poverty alleviation agenda into sustainability transitions studies in developing countries. We propose areas of further reflection attempting to inspire future research pathways.

AB This study identifies systemic problems and opportunities for transitions in water harvesting - a water conserving agricultural practice in the context of a developing country pursuing greater agricultural sustain ability. We utilize a combined and enriched functional-structural technological innovation system (TIS) analysis to identify systemic problems in the water harvesting TIS in rainfed agricultural production systems of Jordan. Results indicate Jordanian water harvesting TIS development is hindered by three principal blocking mechanisms: 1) inadequate financial resources to support innovation; 2) lack of a common vision across government ministries; 3) institutional problems that inhibit legitimizing the technology. These challenges are caused by interlocking systemic problems, which indicate the need for integrated policy approaches and interventions. Our analysis reinforces the concept that in developing countries, donor interventions should be centrally considered because they play a role in influencing priorities throughout the system and in supporting TIS development. Donors can counteract TIS development and contribute to directionality problems that favor one form of the technology over another, which gives insufficient protection for the water harvesting TIS until markets for technologies form. This would require more effective coordination between different donors' efforts to develop critical mass in TIS development. We also show that cultural institutions and interactions between formal and informal land tenure laws play a significant role in causing an erosion of trust in the government and counter efforts to promote and engage farming communities in water harvesting activities and innovation. This requires recognition that, in developing countries, informal institutions may have the same status as formal institutions.

AB Globally, 756 million people in urban areas have no access to improved sanitation, while the urban population is increasing rapidly. Providing toilets has often not been a sustainable solution because of failure to link them to the necessary service infrastructure. Resolving urban sanitation problems in low-income countries requires innovations in approaches covering infrastructure, technology, social embedding, financial mechanisms and cost recovery. This paper explores the potential challenges and contribution of NGOs in facilitating new, integrated solutions to urban sanitation problems that address the entire sanitation chain, promising better social, financial and environmental sustainability. A case study of a sanitation project initiated by a large Dutch NGO is presented, using reconstruction of project documentation and interviews with project stakeholders. The analytical framework combines elements from Transition Management (TM) with insights from process approaches to development projects and community development. The choice of the TM concept is motivated by the notion that the new NGO approaches could be conceived as efforts to initiate a sustainability transition process in urban sanitation, whereas its complementation with insights from the development studies domain answers to the need to attune a TM-based framework to participation in the socio-institutional context in low-income countries, to understand the progress of governing transition processes in informal, low-income settings. This context requires special attention for capacity-building and creation of organizational structures in poor local communities. The case study shows that this entailed specialised groundwork, with which the NGO laid a crucial foundation that enabled transition frontrunners to act. Simultaneously, this focus on bottom-up empowerment created challenges for the NGO in effectively involving the right frontrunner actors who could put pressure on incumbent societal structures and institutions. We conclude that transitions in low-income contexts require extra attention to local empowerment and institution building to lay the required foundations for a locally rooted transition process. Development NGOs like the one in our case study have the skills to do this, but need to learn how to combine these with additional necessary competences to facilitate systemic change.

AB Climate change is expected to pose grave consequences to communities around the world. It is predicted that many people, mostly in the developing world, will experience shortages of water and food as well as numerous health-related effects because of climate change. Therefore, rigorous global action is needed to enable developing countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. Universities play a pivotal role in addressing these issues and their impacts through research and technological innovations. Hence, assessing the extent to which university students understand climate change and its impacts displays the extent of hope in mitigating future changes in climatic conditions. This article assesses the knowledge and understanding of climate change and its impacts by students at an institution of higher learning in South Africa. This study utilised a quantitative approach and a descriptive design. The convenience method was used to obtain participants for the study. Self-administered questionnaires were utilised in a survey to collect data from the participants. A sample of 90 university students participated in the survey. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and T-tests. Reliability was measured using the Cronbach's alpha. The study discovered that university students have low knowledge and understanding of climate change. As a result, the study concluded that if students could be well-informed about climate change issues, they could positively contribute to the development of their communities by crafting smart climate change mitigation and adaptation skills.

TI Strategies for achieving environmental policy integration at the
   landscape level. A framework illustrated with an analysis of landscape
   governance in Rwanda

AB Environmental Policy Integration (EPI) refers to the incorporation of environmental concerns into sectoral policies in order to reduce policy incoherence and achieve synergies to more effectively address environmental problems such as environmental degradation. Landscape governance can be considered as a specific, spatial manifestation of EPI: it aims to balance agricultural production, nature conservation and livelihood needs at the landscape level through multi-stakeholder decision making. Despite their common focus on policy conflicts, both concepts have been elaborated in largely isolated bodies of literature, while little is known about their common concern of how actors at the landscape level deal with these policy conflicts. This paper addresses this under explored theme, by drawing from both EPI and landscape governance theories, and adding new insights from institutional and innovation literature. We develop a framework specifying how actors at local, district and national levels deal with policy conflicts and employ strategies to overcome them. We illustrate the analytical framework with a case from Rwanda, where landscape restoration has become a new policy area which has brought sectoral policy conflicts to the fore. We characterise these policy conflicts, and analyse the ways in which local, district and national actors manage to overcome them, by using the landscape as a functional regulatory space for policy integration. What we learn from this case is that EPI is not just designed at national levels by formally assigned policy makers, but it happens in landscapes where landscape actors define their priorities and set hierarchically defined policy objectives to their hand. They flexibly fit in and conform to existing rules yet informally combining these to suit their spatial context; or they entrepreneurially stretch and transform the rules, while seeking alliances with policy makers to have the outcomes institutionalised. In both cases they contribute to solving policy conflicts in both the horizontal and the vertical sense. By doing so, we show the usefulness of the framework for identifying policy conflicts and contributing to policy integration at the landscape level.

AB Background: Diabetes emerges out to be a major epidemic in recent years that engulfs both developed and developing countries across the globe. India, a country witnessing rapid socioeconomic progress and urbanization carries a considerable share of the global diabetes burden. There has been an incongruity between disease burden and the technical capacity to make use of existing knowledge or to generate new knowledge to combat diabetes in India.
   Aim: This paper examines the role of different actors, organizations & institutions in shaping diabetology research in India using arrays of scientific indicators such as research output (publications and patents), research finance and role of policy-making bodies. This paper also identifies research gaps and challenges pertinent to this sector.
   Methodology: A combination of three methods patent data analysis, publication data analysis and primary survey corroborated with secondary data to obtain desire objectives. We made an in-depth study of the patent and publication data (2000-2016) to know the research output and direction of Indian actors, institutions and organizations in the area of diabetes research.
   Results: This paper identifies some key structural barriers and institutional challenges pertinent to diabetology research in India that will help in canvassing and formulating science, technology and policy guidelines for diabetology research in India
   Conclusion: Multilevel intervention requires bridging the gap between knowledge and action hence policy-making should align to balance resources with innovation capabilities. (C) 2017 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the last 10 years, considerable work has been done to promote and improve neurosurgical care in East Africa with the development of national training programs, expansion of hospitals and creation of new institutions, and the foundation of epidemiologic and cost-effectiveness research. Many of the results have been accomplished through collaboration with partners from abroad. This article is the third in a series of articles that seek to provide readers with an understanding of the development of neurosurgery in East Africa (Foundations), the challenges that arise in providing neurosurgical care in developing countries (Challenges), and an overview of traditional and novel approaches to overcoming these challenges to improve healthcare in the region (Innovations). In this article, we describe the ongoing programs active in East Africa and their current priorities, and we outline lessons learned and what is required to create self-sustained neurosurgical service.

AB This study tests the impact of export and foreign technology on the indicators of firm's performance for a sample of Indian manufacturing firms. To provide new insights into the debate over the linkage among export, technology, and performance, we employ several important performance indicators of firms, such as labor productivity, total factor productivity, product and process innovation, wage, size, and capacity utilization. For this study, we utilize a sample of firms from a recent Enterprise Surveys data of the World Bank on Indian manufacturing. The results of the analysis indicate that exporters are more productive and innovative. They are also large and utilize the capacity in a better way. The results further indicate that export leads to substantial performance gain for Indian firms. Similar results are also estimated for the effects of the use of foreign technology in the production process. Our findings also suggest that exporting products to the developed world have a significant effect on performance and further indicate that single product firms are more benefited from export and technology transfer than multi-product firms. It is also found that firms with more productivity decide to export their products; however, technology transfer is not a significant factor in making decisions about export or enhancing export-intensity. Overall, our analysis supports the argument that research and development (R&D) in the developed countries is an important source of technology for developing countries, and this takes place through export as well as direct technology transfer.

AB Endogenous growth models raise fundamental questions about the nature of human creativity, and the sorts of resources, skills, and knowledge inputs that shift the frontier of technology and production possibilities. Many argue that the experience of early British industrialization supports the thesis that economic advances depend on specialized scientific training, the acquisition of costly human capital, and the role of elites. This paper examines the contributions of different types of knowledge to industrialization, by assessing the backgrounds, education and inventive activity of major contributors to technological advances in Britain during the crucial period between 1750 and 1930. The results indicate that scientists, engineers or technicians were not well-represented among the cadre of important British inventors, and their contributions remained unspecialized until very late in the nineteenth century. The informal institution of apprenticeship and learning on the job provided effective means to enable productivity and innovation. For developing countries today, the implications are that costly investments in specialized human capital resources might be less important than incentives for creativity, flexibility, and the ability to make incremental adjustments that can transform existing technologies into inventions and innovations that are appropriate for prevailing domestic conditions.

AB Renewable energy is well recognized not only as resource that helps to protect the environment for future generations but also as a driver for development. Waste-to-energy systems can provide renewable energy and also improve sustainability in waste management. This article contributes a case study of stepwise reconfiguration of the waste management system in a developing country to the literature of transitions. The conditions for a systemic transition that integrates large-scale biogas generation into the waste management system have been analyzed. The method included a multi-criteria evaluation of three development steps for biogas, an economic analysis, and an institutional and organizational analysis. The results revealed economic as well as institutional and organizational barriers. Clearly, public and private sectors need to engage in sustainability. There is also a lack of pressure - mainly because of fossil fuel subsidies - that prevents a transition and creates a lock-in effect. To break the lock-in effect the municipality's institutional capacity should be strengthened. It is possible to strengthen biogas economically by integrated waste management services and sales of biofertilizer. A stepwise reconfiguration would be initiated by adopting technologies that are already established in many developed countries but are novelties in a Bolivian context - as a response to sustainability challenges related to waste management. The article focuses on the main challenges and the potential for biogas technology in Bolivia and a pathway towards a new, more sustainable system is suggested. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Much in line with what has been happening in developed economies for the past few decades, policy decision makers and industry strategists in developing countries have dedicated increased attention to initiatives that foster University-Industry Collaboration (UIC). The overarching goal is to enhance the capabilities/efficiencies of innovation systems, leveraging the role of universities as generators and disseminators of valuable knowledge, highly concentrated in academia in these laggard nations. In this article we empirically assess the extent to which institutional openness in universities towards UIC linkages affect the generation of knowledge-intensive spin-offs and academic patenting activity in the context of the State of So Paulo, Brazil. We use data for 462 knowledge-intensive entrepreneurial projects related to academics receiving grants from the PIPE Program of the State of So Paulo, Brazil, as well as international patenting behavior for 126 universities and research institutes. Additionally, we have gathered data for UIC activity (2002-2010) in the affected region. The main novelty of our approach is to qualify UIC according to three different dimensions of openness, focusing on UIC levels and objects of collaboration. Results suggest that the quality of linkages (collaboration content) is a stronger predictor of both types of university entrepreneurship than the extent to which universities are connected to firms.

AB This article analyses the socio-political transformations observed in two artisanal gold mining sites in West Africa (Guinee Conakry and Burkina Faso), linked to economic cycles and technical innovations. The notion of timescape(s) is employed to underline the intertwining of the spatial and temporal dimensions of mining, and to show the contradictory movements of compression and release of space and time to which local modes of production and institutional settings have been exposed. These transformations have generated shifts in the power to "make time" - that is, to define the rhythms and duration of work in the present and to plan mining activities in the future - triggering political reconfigurations in order to (re)appropriate control over the resource.

FX Fieldwork in Tonso was conducted in 2014 in the framework of a baseline
   study on artisanal mining in the area of Siguiri for the consulting firm
   Insuco, with funding from AngloGold Ashanti. The Laboratoire
   Citoyennetes (Ouagadougou) and the Swiss association Agedeve, with
   funding from the canton of Geneva (Switzerland), supported my initial
   fieldwork in Gombeledougou in 2012. I am indebted to my colleagues and
   collaborators in the field, and particularly to Luigi Arnaldi di Balme,
   David Leyle, Ibrahima Diawara, Sekou Berete, Peter Hochet, Alizeta
   Ouedraogo, Ibrahima Sanou, Gaston Kabore and Abdel Aziz Diallo. I also
   want to thank the editors and contributors of this special issue for
   insightful comments and discussions, and the anonymous reviewers for
   helping to improve the text.

AB The role of innovation and institutional quality for achieving sustainability are important issues tackled by current sustainable development debates, particularly in developing countries. Using a modified environmental Kuznets curve model, the present study improves our understanding of the critical roles of innovation, institutional quality, and entrepreneurship in structural change toward a sustainable future for Africa. Our empirical results show that formal and informal entrepreneurship are conducive to reduced environmental quality and sustainability in 17 African countries however informal entrepreneurship contributes more than formal entrepreneurship to this environmental degradation. The relationship between entrepreneurship and sustainable development turns strongly positive in the presence of high levels of innovation and institutional quality. This study contributes to this emerging research strand by clarifying the conditions that allow African countries to move toward more sustainable economies.

TI Q method to map the diversity of stakeholder viewpoints along
   agricultural innovation systems: a case study on cattle genetic
   improvement in Niger
SO ARCHIVES ANIMAL BREEDING
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; MANAGEMENT; ETHIOPIA
AB The complex balance between innovation and conservation regarding animal genetic resources makes it difficult to find mutually accepted improvement pathways between breeders, government agencies, and research and education institutions. This study maps stakeholder viewpoints on cattle genetic improvement in Niger using the Q method. Fifty-three statements derived from expert opinions and focus group interviews were ranked by 22 respondents along a seven-grade scale expressing their degree of approval. The Q method reveals a limited consensus on development goals, overall strategy, and the present context of operation. Beyond this consensus, three discourses are identified that express distinct attitudes regarding the balance between conservation and progress, leading to distinct strategies. The first discourse fits with a modernist vision and government strategies established in the 2000s based on exotic crossbreeding and improved purebred Azawak. The second discourse lines up with the previous livestock development strategy of Niger (before 2000) based on indigenous breeds. The third discourse represents a conservationist vision, with minor importance in the present sampling. Tentative observations are proposed on the consequences of this divide in opinions on livestock policies in Niger, including extension. The Q method appears effective in identifying the concerns of stakeholders on complex agricultural innovation topics. As a sensing tool to follow-up policy implementation in similarly complex agricultural topics, the Q method may inform adaptive extension and education strategies.

TI An institutional diagnostics of agricultural innovation; public-private

AB This paper presents and discusses a diagnostic framework to identify institutional processes in the creation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for agricultural innovation. The diagnostic framework proposed here combines a conceptualisation of institutions with a conceptualisation of technology. We argue that a performative notion of institutions provides a better tool for institutional diagnostics than the common understanding of institutions as 'rules of the game'. The paper furthermore proposes to conceptualise technology as affordance, in contrast to a more common understanding of technology as an input. We explore the value of our diagnostic framework by analysing the literature on PPPs for agricultural innovation and unpublished data from a PPP initiative for smallholder sorghum production, based on an agreement between Uganda's National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) and Nile Breweries Limited (NBL). In the discussion and conclusion section we evaluate the benefits of our diagnostic framework and discuss how the empirical issues it brings forward create important lessons for analysis of innovation for African smallholder farming and institutional diagnostics more generally.

TI Multi-scale governance in agriculture systems: Interplay between

   security in Mali

AB Enforcement of rules and laws designed at the national level is still one of the dominant institutional mechanisms for effective multiscale governance in most countries. At times, such blanket regulations are not only unable to meet practical needs at local levels, but they may conflict with local institutional logics, thereby creating new challenges. This study looks at three institutional arrangements in the agriculture and food security sector in the district of Koutiala, Mali to analyse the institutional variety across scale and the underlying institutional logics. On one side, the Cooperative Law as well as the Seed Law both designed at national level to enable famers' access to agriculture services and improved seeds have yielded mixed results with regard to anticipated outcomes. The cooperative law is believed to degrade the social cohesion and the mutual support on which vulnerable farmers rely when facing climatic and non-climatic risks whereas the new seed system is found onerous and unaffordable for farmers. On the other side, the local convention for the management of natural resources established as part of ongoing decentralised governance policy seems to resonate with local culture but challenged by other stakeholders. Through exploring these cases, this paper tests bricolage as an analytical framework for doing an institutional diagnostic. It aims at contributing to methodological and theoretical insights on the way sustainable institutions can be generated in conflicting institutional logics in the context of multi-scale governance.

AB While the growing availability of mobile phones has commanded the attention of the development community, an estimated 844 million people continue to lack access to basic drinking water and 2.3 billion to adequate sanitation. Development has now begun of mobile applications to improve access to water, sanitation and hygiene services (mWASH). To understand the barriers to innovation, nine mWASH applications were studied using the Framework for Analyzing a Multi-level Innovation System (FAMIS), a conceptual model. Applying FAMIS to a technology aids in understanding when and why it succeeds or fails, and how key stakeholders and institutions can be targeted for intervention. The analysis highlights ways to overcome barriers to innovation and suggests that the technology is less important than the way in which it is implemented.

AB Due to the irregular nature of solar resource, solar photovoltaic (PV) system alone cannot satisfy load on a 24/7 demand basis, especially with increasing regional population in developing countries such as Thailand. A hybrid solar PV/biomass based along with battery storage system has been drawing more attention to option since it promises great deal of challenges and opportunities for different rural areas. Thailand rich with higher level of agricultural crops and biomass materials is a prospective candidate for deployment of bio-power to complement such hybrid systems. To this end, in this study a customized hybrid power system integrating solar, biomass (syngas) power and battery storage system is evaluated a pilot scale for micro off-grid application. This paper shows that for a reliability of a hybrid syngas/solar PV system along with rechargeable batteries, the syngas generator can guarantee a continuous 24 h electricity supply in case of shortage of energy (during on cloudy day and at the nighttime). Two consecutive days of commissioning phase are necessary for the entire system to operate, which is a solid basis for including the syngas generator in the hybrid system. Furthermore, the generator has to be always synchronized during the commissioning time. Battery state of charge (SOC) in percent (%) connecting with syngas is greater than solar PV and the charging time appears significantly shorter than that one. All possible combinations between an innovation and existing systems can serve as a guideline for making similar studies in the context of different off-grid sites and more. Next, optimal scale up and design of hybrid power system for different off grid applications will be performed including comprehensive uncertainty analysis to facilitate robust and renewable electricity generation.

AB Contract farming (CF), an institutional innovation, can reduce transaction costs and solve market imperfections in many developing countries. This study compares productivity and technical efficiency (TE) of contract and independent producers of high yielding variety (HYV) paddy seed (a low-value crop) and ginger (a high-value crop) producers in a sample of smallholders in Nepal. We address the self-selection into CF by using propensity score matching and translog stochastic frontier function to estimate our empirical model. Using farm-level data from Nepal, our findings show that CF increased the average TE levels of HYV paddy seed producers from 87% to 94% and the average TE levels of ginger producers from 89% to 97%. Finally, we find that human capital and distance to the market increases the technical inefficiency of low-value crop smallholders in Nepal.

AB Although a substantial literature on the management of technological innovation exists, several scholars argue that much of this research has been rooted in Western contexts, where key assumptions are very different from those in emerging economies. Building on this viewpoint, we investigate the current state of knowledge on technological innovation in two of the largest and fastest growing emerging economies: China and India. We undertook a bibliometric analysis of author keywords and combined different quantitative approaches - frequency analysis, cluster analysis, and co-word analysis - to review 162 articles on technological innovation published about China and India for the period 1991-2015. From the analyses, the trends in technological innovation research in the two countries and the dominant themes of discussion were identified. These themes were further classified into eight sub-themes. Our key findings indicate a near absence of research on the management of technological innovation based on India, limited volume of research on indigenous aspects of innovation, and a lack of theory-building based on these countries' contexts. Several suggestions for future research are offered based on the gaps identified.

AB Previous studies have found that reverse technology spillover effects can promote industrial technology modernization in developing countries. However, it is still unknown whether reverse technology spillover effects can improve green innovation efficiency in developing countries. In particular, institutional uncertainties characteristic of transition economies have a significant impact on industrial modernization. Therefore, researching the impact of the institutional environment on the relationship between reverse technology spillover effects and green innovation efficiency is of great significance. In this paper, we use data from G20 countries as well as China's foreign direct investment (FDI) data to measure the effects of reverse technology spillovers and adopt the threshold effect model to explore the relationship between reverse technology spillover effects and green innovation efficiency as well as the influence of the institutional environment on this relationship, based on China's provincial panel data from 2003 to 2015. The empirical results show that the reverse technology spillover effects can effectively improve green innovation efficiency. There is a threshold for the influence of the institutional environment on the relationship between reverse technology spillover effects and green innovation efficiency. When the institutional development level surpasses the threshold value, an acceleration effect is generated. In addition, we find that the legal system is the key bottleneck in terms of improving green innovation efficiency. How to improve and perfect the path of institutional construction in China and how to enable institutions to gain threshold speed-up effects have become the major problems the Chinese government faces in institutional construction. The research results of this paper offer a reference to developing countries in regard to improving their institutions and enhancing their green innovation efficiency.

AB The narrative about the future of money in developing countries is dominated by international financial institutions (IFIs) and their affiliates, multinational payment service providers, mobile network operators and academia. Most have reduced the future of money or monetary needs of the unbanked to the eradication of cash by digitization. In contrast to this techno-centric narrative, in this article, I situate the future of money in a new sociotechnical model which I refer to as the quantity, quality and public authority deficit (QPAD) hypothesis. It recognizes three disadvantages (or deficits) from the use of money: quantitative limits, which relates to the fact that its capacity to act as medium of exchange, is conditional on its availability; a qualitative deficit, involving the failure to embody attributes of transacting parties (identity, reputation etc.); and a public authority deficit, represented by weak central authority involvement in addressing the monetary needs of the unbanked poor. On this basis, any future inclusive monetary innovations which do not address these three deficits will most likely be unsuccessful. These ideas are based on findings from a participatory ethnographic study that draws on a sociology of scientific knowledge framework (Mackenzie, 1996; Pinch and Bijker, 1984; Spinardi, 2008) to evaluate technological properties of the Edinburgh local exchange trading scheme (LETS)-issued virtual currency. This currency is compared and contrasted with the properties of government-issued money. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are often accused of taking advantage of lax environmental regulations in developing countries. However, no quantitative analysis of the impact of doing business in nations of different income levels on environmental corporate social responsibility (ECSR) has been done prior to this study. Incorporating institutional factors in our approach, we argue that endoisomorphic and exoisomorphic pressures relating to ECSR impact MNEs differently according to the MNEs' level of activity in low-, lower-middle-, upper-middle-, and high-income nations. We predict and, using data from 113 companies, find that selling in poorer nations is positively associated with increased levels of ECSR. Our research suggests that MNEs may not be participating in a "race to the bottom" but may instead be responding to global institutional pressure by exceeding local norms for environmental stewardship. Alternative interpretations of our findings are discussed.

AB There has been an emerging view that the quality of state institutions can influence technology transfer in host countries. The bulk of such studies have ignored the role of intermediate institutions which bridge government and industry. We compare academic and local expert views of how technology and knowledge (T&K) transfer could be enhanced in the developing world, taking the Ghanaian construction industry as an exemplar. The academic argument that the development of strong intermediate institutions is likely to improve T&K policy and practice is explicated. We then investigate expert perceptions of the industry's T&K transfer problems and their proposed solutions. Their views confirm, but also develop and nuance academic research by suggesting that certain types of intermediate institutions have a more significant role to play than others.

AB The electricity distribution industry in the developing world is dominated by public sector utilities. These utilities are technically and economically inefficient and face large financial losses that prevent further development of the networks. The reforms are introduced to unbundle the vertically integrated utilities and introduce private investment and management, but these efforts often fail due to poorly designed market and incentive models. Focusing on the electricity distribution in developing countries, we propose a business model based on organizing the utilities into distinct activities and businesses. In many developing countries political economy and weak investment conditions do not favour full privatization of utilities. However, in some activities 'competition for the market' and 'management contracts' can provide a partial role for the private actors. The model is based on the concepts of enterprise innovation, emphasizing external collaboration and partnerships and can be operationalized via specialization, where some specific tasks are outsourced. The proposed model can also be applied to developed countries as the energy sectors of both developing and developed countries are undergoing transformation due to new technologies such as communications, distributed generation (DGs), and active demand response.

AB In the process of transitioning from closed to open innovation, regions in developing countries need to understand how to choose the most effective path within the complex innovation system while considering their own innovation factors. Based on provincial panel data from China's high-tech industry and the improved dynamic threshold model, we introduce the threshold of knowledge accumulation (KLA) into the non-linear mechanism between innovation paths and innovation performance to compare the dynamic threshold effect and its heterogeneity. This research provides interesting insights into innovation paths, showing that the relationship between the innovation path and innovation performance is significantly influenced by the threshold effect of KLA. As the level of KLA strengthens, its effects on each innovation path change. Overall, this article shows how KLA affects the relationship between the innovation path and innovation performance. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these insights for innovation management and policy.

AB Integrating political, bureaucratic, industrial and healthcare systems has been a major challenge for politics of innovation and development policy in low- and middle-income countries. This challenge has so far been understood in terms of separate industrial and health-related innovation policies without paying adequate attention to the institutional roles of biopharmaceutical and other umbrella associations. This article seeks to examine such roles in the developmental contexts of South Africa and India. The argument put forward is that, in both countries, biopharmaceutical and umbrella associations have evolved from lobbying organizations to institutional partners who influence the politics of innovation and developmentand therefore the degree of integration and fragmentationof political, bureaucratic, industrial innovation and health systems.

AB The potential of participatory scenario processes to catalyse individual and collective transformation and policy change is emphasised in several theoretical reflections. Participatory scenario processes are believed to enhance participants' systems understanding, learning, networking and subsequent changes in practices. However, limited empirical evidence is available to prove these assumptions. This study aimed to contribute to this knowledge gap. It evaluates whether these outcomes had resulted from the scenario planning exercise and the extent to which they can contribute to transformational processes. The research focused on a district level case study in rural Mali which examined food security and necessary policy changes in the context of climate change. The analyses of interviews with 26 participants carried out 12 months after the workshop suggested positive changes in learning and networking, but only limited influence on systems understanding. There was limited change in practice, but the reported changes occurred at the individual level, and no policy outcomes were evident. However, by building the adaptive capacity of participants, the scenario process had laid the foundation for ongoing collective action, and potential institutional and policy transformation. We conclude that to enhance the resilience of agricultural and food systems under climate change, participatory scenario processes require a broader range of cross-scale actors' engagement to support transformational changes. Such process will both catalyse deeper learning and more effective link with national level policy making process. In addition, individual scenario planning exercises are unlikely to generate sufficient learning and reflection, and instead they should form one component of more extensive and deliberate stakeholder engagement, learning and evaluation processes.

TI Stories of tragedy, trust and transformation? A case study of
   education-centered community development in post-earthquake Haiti

AB Haiti's catastrophic earthquake of 2010 left approximately 200,000 people dead, 1.5 million homeless and most government buildings destroyed. Even pre-disaster, Haiti's outcomes on the UN Human Development Index were among the lowest in the world, and since the quake the country has fallen into further decline. Today, most Haitians continue to lack basic services, struggle with daily survival, and confront daunting challenges in their change efforts. Many have called for reconstruction of society, and argue that local civil society organizations should lead the way in these efforts by valuing local knowledge, and building on small-scale community successes. This research investigates one community's change efforts toward a new form of community development and potential pathway to transformation in Haiti. We aim to apply learning from this case to inform development practice and policy in Haiti and similar contexts.
   The case study community, Bellevue-La-Montagne, is applying an education-centered community development approach which has placed construction of a new school and education at the heart of collaborative rebuilding efforts by local residents and organizations, primarily Haiti Partners. Education and participatory practices are embedded in all aspects of the community development, including: social entrepreneurship, healthcare, environmental stewardship, community agriculture, planning and construction. These efforts involve participation of people and organizations (local and international) in dialogical negotiations that aim to share power and build capabilities of local people, and to create, change, or preserve structures and institutions consistent with the interests of local people. Participatory and phronesis research methodologies reveal nuanced understandings of the community development and its meaning for local people. In spite of substantial progress in development projects, findings reveal tension points that potentially threaten long-term sustainability, such as: the highly fragile nature of state-society relations, lack of a sense of agency of local people despite strong levels of participation, and differences between outcomes for the community as a whole and individual households.
   Moving from revealed community change in this case to a broader and deeper social transformation will require key 'levers of transformation', identified in this case as: 1) education; 2) place identity, networks, and research; 3) social entrepreneurship and social innovation; and 4) state-society trust and accountability. These levers can be activated through participatory and education-centered community development strategies that provide important roles for local people and civil society, and a nuanced role for international organizations which is sensitive to power dynamics. Such development strategies would give 'voice' to communities in their struggles for change. Strengthening, networking and scaling community level innovation that shows promise of transformation, such as the case of Bellevue-La-Montagne, would contribute to Haiti's attempts to forge a new narrative, and to evolving international development planning policy and practice.

AB This paper contributes to intellectual discourse on the impact of barriers to firms' innovative performance and external search strategies in the context of a developing country. Using data from the 2011 Nigeria's innovation survey in the manufacturing sector, we tested three hypotheses: the relationship between barriers and firms' innovativeness, breadth and depth of external knowledge sources. We found that firms' innovativeness can decrease when they encounter a broad range of organisational rigidities. On the contrary, firms' innovativeness increase in the face of regulatory constraints as firms may evolve ways to circumvent problematic bureaucracies while expectedly, as knowledge and infrastructure barriers become more intense, firms find it difficult to implement innovations. Similarly, we found that higher intensity of barriers, particularly knowledge and infrastructure barriers is associated with lower breadth of search. Hence, our results underscore the importance of regulation and infrastructure as key requirements for enhancing not only firm-level innovation but also knowledge search activities of firms.

AB Despite considerable field-based innovation and academic scrutiny, the nexus between conservation approaches, local support for parks and park effectiveness remains quite puzzling. Common approaches to understanding notions of environmental justice are to understand distributional and procedural issues, representation in decision making, and recognition of authorities and claims. We took a different approach and analysed environmental justice claims through institutional, ideational and psychological lenses. We sought to understand how the national park could have such broad support from local communities despite their acknowledgement that it severely curtailed their livelihoods. We conducted 100 household interviews in three villages that border Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area. Our study found that villagers 1) hold on to broken promises by the State for agricultural activities and alternative revenues without fully changing forest use behaviours; 2) were influenced heavily by the 'educational' programmes by the State; 3) accepted the authority of the State and lack of participation in decision-making based on historical experiences and values; 4) justified their burdens by over-emphasising the positive aspects of the park. Our findings present a complementary framework to explain environmental justice claims, allowing for a nuanced analysis of how people respond to justices and injustices, and specifically how injustices can be identified through proven social science concepts.

   AGENDA
AB Gross national income (GNI) per capita is widely regarded as a key determinant of health outcomes. Major donors heavily rely on GNI per capita to allocate development assistance for health (DAH). This article questions this paradigm by analysing the determinants of health outcomes using cross-sectional data from 99 countries in 2012. We use disability-adjusted life years (Group I) per capita as our main indicator for health outcomes. We consider four primary variables: GNI per capita, institutional capacity, individual poverty and the epidemiological surroundings. Our empirical strategy has two innovations. First, we construct a health poverty line of 10.89 international-$ per day, which measures the minimum level of income an individual needs to have access to basic healthcare. Second, we take the contagious nature of communicable diseases into account, by estimating the extent to which the population health in neighbouring countries (the epidemiological surroundings) affects health outcomes. We apply a spatial two-stage least-squares model to mitigate the risks of reverse causality. Our model captures 92% of the variation in health outcomes. We emphasize four findings. First, GNI per capita is not a significant predictor of health outcomes once other factors are controlled for. Second, the poverty gap below the 10.89 health poverty line is a good measure of universal access to healthcare, as it explains 19% of deviation in health outcomes. Third, the epidemiological surroundings in which countries are embedded capture as much as 47% of deviation in health outcomes. Finally, institutional capacity explains 10% of deviation in health outcomes. Our empirical findings suggest that allocation frameworks for DAH should not only take into account national income, which remains an important indicator of countries' financial capacity, but also individual poverty, governance and epidemiological surroundings to increase impact on health outcomes.

AB Identifying trajectories of agricultural development that enable substantial increases in food production is of prime importance for food security and human development in Sub-Saharan Africa in general, and Ethiopia in particular. To ensure long-term welfare for people and landscapes, it is imperative that such agricultural transformations sustain and enhance the natural resource base upon which agriculture depends. To understand the prospects for a sustainable transformation of Ethiopian agriculture we develop a new conceptual framework for sustainability transformations that combines insights from the social-ecological transformations literature with research on socio-technical transitions and institutional entrepreneurship. Using this framework, we analyse the agricultural development trajectory currently envisaged by the government, as expressed in policy narratives and public institutions. We also explore the opportunity context facing non-state actors who promote sustainable intensification (referred to as green niche actors), as well as the strategies they employ to navigate this context and lever change in the direction they perceive as desirable. We find that current policies for agricultural development are primarily dominated by a narrative of Agriculture as an engine for growth, which focuses on the role of external inputs and commercialisation in boosting agricultural production so as to drive economic growth. While another narrative of Natural resource rehabilitation exists in policy, it sees natural resource management as a means of reducing degradation rather than a crucial component of enhanced and sustainable agricultural production, and the policies largely decouple issues of natural resources from issues of agricultural production. Institutional structures in the agricultural sector are found to reflect these discursive patterns. Further, the general institutional context in the country is characterised by strong government domination and rigid structures, which indicates an opaque opportunity context with limited opportunities for niche actors to have an impact. Given these challenging conditions, green niche actors adapt their strategies to fit the existing opportunity context and choose to collaborate closely with the government and the extension system. While this strategy offers the possibility of a direct impact at potentially large scale, it also leads to a range of trade-offs for the green niche actors and ultimately reduces the prospects for a sustainable agricultural transformation. In conclusion, an adaptation of the regime's proposed development trajectory for Ethiopian agriculture is, under current conditions, a more likely scenario than a more fundamental sustainability transformation, although options remain for more transformative action. Through the case of Ethiopian agriculture, this study adds insights into how transformation processes could play out in non-Western contexts where a strong state plays a dominant role, thus broadening the scope of empirical applications of the emerging research field on social-ecological transformations. We also demonstrate how the multilevel perspective from the transition literature and the concepts of opportunity context and situated agency from the literature on institutional entrepreneurship can be fruitfully merged with the social-ecological transformations literature, thereby moving towards a more comprehensive conceptual framework for analysing sustainability transformations.

AB Background: Most developing countries face important challenges regarding the quality of health care, and there is a growing consensus that health workers play a key role in this process. Our understanding as to what are the key institutional challenges in human resources, and their underlying driving forces, is more limited. A conceptual framework that structures existing insights and provides concrete directions for policymaking is also missing.
   Methods: To gain a bottom-up perspective, we gather qualitative data through semi-structured interviews with different levels of health workers and users of health services in rural and urban Rwanda. We conducted discussions with 48 health workers and 25 users of health services in nine different groups in 2005. We maximized within-group heterogeneity by selecting participants using specific criteria that affect health worker performance and career choice. The discussion were analysed electronically, to identify key themes and insights, and are documented with a descriptive quantitative analysis relating to the associations between quotations. The findings from this research are then revisited 10 years later making use of detailed follow-up studies that have been carried out since then.
   Results: The original discussions identified both key challenges in human resources for health and driving forces of these challenges, as well as possible solutions. Two sets of issues were highlighted: those related to the size and distribution of the workforce and those related to health workers' on-the-job performance. Among the latter, four categories were identified: health workers' poor attitudes towards patients, absenteeism, corruption and embezzlement and lack of medical skills among some categories of health workers. The discussion suggest that four components constitute the deeper causal factors, which are, ranked in order of ease of malleability, incentives, monitoring arrangements, professional and workplace norms and intrinsic motivation. Three institutional innovations are identified that aim at improving performance: performance pay, community health workers and increased attention to training of health workers. Revisiting the findings from this primary research making use of later in-depth studies, the analysis demonstrates their continued relevance and usefulness. We discuss how the different factors affect the quality of care by impacting on health worker performance and labour market choices, making use of insights from economics and development studies on the role of institutions.
   Conclusion: The study results indicate that health care quality to an important degree depends on four institutional factors at the microlevel that strongly impact on health workers' performance and career choice, and which deserve more attention in applied research and policy reform. The analysis also helps to identify ways forwards, which fit well with the Ministry's most recent strategic plan.

AB About half of the secondary school teachers in Malawi are professionally unqualified. Furthermore, the net enrolment of eligible pupils in secondary schools is at 36% per year. Hence, this study sought to establish factors affecting access to quality and relevant secondary education in Malawi with reference to coordination, collaboration, and feedback between secondary school teacher education institutions and the Ministry of Education. Officials from the Ministry of Education and secondary school teacher training colleges participated in the study. Findings suggest that there is weak collaboration, coordination, and feedback between teacher training institutions and the Ministry of Education which is affecting the quality and relevance of education in Malawi. The study has also established that the weak linkage has resulted into perceived mismatches between expectations of the ministry and those of the education institutions about the problem in question. Theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed in this article.

AB There is considerable consensus that a key to addressing the serious socio-ecological crises facing the world is for organizations to implement innovations that foster sustainable development. Drawing from the sustainability, innovation, and Resource Based View literature, this paper aims to examine the organizational capabilities associated with promoting a particular sustainable innovation Conservation Agriculture among small-scale farmers in low-income countries. Findings suggest that a paradigm shift is needed to what we call Sustainable Innovation 2.0. Sustainable Innovation 2.0 is associated with a double bottom line approach to sustainability that seeks to enhance positive socio-ecological externalities while maintaining financially viable organizations (i.e., financial well-being is subservient to socio-ecological well-being). We describe how Sustainable Innovation 2.0 is associated with: i) making rare sustainable innovations commonplace; ii) making inimitable emerging sustainable innovations transferable; and iii) developing institutional infrastructures and bundles of resources that counteract the non-substitutability of sustainable innovations. We discuss the implications of these ideas for the associated literature and for future research. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI National Laboratories: a Strategy for Scientific and Technological
   Development Geared to Innovation
SO SOCIOLOGIA NAUKI I TEHNOLOGIJ-SOCIOLOGY OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of governmental financing of science and technology was born in the Western World as early as the 17th Century. Both Great Britain and France became aware of the need to protect and enhance the scientific achievements of their scientists, mainly for reasons of international prestige. The USA witnessed a spectacular growth of its scientific facilities in the 20th Century. The number of National Laboratories expanded out of the massive scientific effort developed during WWII that produced innovative technologies such as the radar, the computer, the proximity fuse and, unfortunately, the atomic bomb. The scale and impact of the mobilization of science for military purposes during WW II was extraordinary and unprecedented. The concept of National Laboratory gradually extended in the USA to include research institutions dedicated to areas of national interest like atmosphere, soil, oceans and health of the population. Although not necessarily identified as National Laboratories, they conserved the characteristic of being financed by the national government. Countries in the process of development have put a lot of interest in the creation and support of National Laboratories, or equivalents, as a strategy to enhance productivity and reduce the gap between developed and developing countries. The chain science-technology-innovation-applications is to be encouraged for both international prestige and increase in revenues at national and international levels. The federal agency that is in charge of planning and implementing Mexican science, technology and innovation policy is the National Council for Science and Technology (Conacyt, in Spanish). In 2006, the institution launched a National Laboratories program through a call for national laboratory candidates that is still in effect today. The applicants submit a project to Conacyt, and commit to the joint development of projects with one or more similar Mexican research institutions. Those who are approved are supported with funds to acquire necessary equipment. Conacyt's ultimate aim is for the laboratories to become self-sufficient with the provision of services, as well as national and international referents in their field of knowledge. A preliminary presentation of a successful Mexican National Laboratory, the National Center of Imaging Studies and Medical Instrumentation (CI3M), is presented as a paradigmatic example of the track laboratories in the program should follow, aimed at accomplishing satisfactorily the objectives of human resource development, production of innovative technology, and provision of services. CI3M not only has fulfilled such areas but has become self-sufficient through the provision of services and the creation of their own enterprises.

AB Financial inclusion has been acclaimed to play a significant role in combating the three evils of poverty, unemployment and poverty, which have been a serious hindrance to the growth path of developing countries like Africa. It was against this that, this paper examined the drivers of financial inclusion in the top ten African economies in terms of gross domestic product growth rate. These include Angola, Algeria, Egypt, Kenya, Libya, Nigeria, Morocco, South Africa, Sudan and Tunisia. Covering a period of 2000 to 2015, using System generalized method of moment, which is considered superior to other panel data models due to its ability to address the problem of omission bias, endogeneity and autocorrelation. The data were obtained from World Development Indicators and Worldwide Governance Indicators which are being considered the most efficient sources of data, especially in developing countries. The study reveal that mobile banking, bank branches, political stability, interest rate, and inflation positively drive financial inclusion while income, access to Automated Teller Machine, and government expenditure have the negative impact on financial inclusion. On the bases of the above findings, it was concluded that mobile banking, bank branches, political stability, interest and inflation rate are the major determinants of financial inclusion in Africa. Based on the conclusion, the study recommends that appropriate financial sector policies and measures should be designed by the stakeholders in the financial system in form of low monetary policy rate to encourage access to financial services by all segment of the society. In addition to strict legislation, the can stop banks exploiting their customers through unnecessary bank charges and ensure the penetration of financial institutions into the rural areas. Fiscal and monetary policies should target an increase in the welfare of the masses especially the low-income earners in the society who are mostly excluded in Africa.

TI ICT and Elections in Nigeria: Rural Dynamics of Biometric Voting

   technology; biometric technology adoption; rural voters
AB Applications of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)-driven innovations are profound in the electoral cycle. Among them, biometric technology is currently sweeping across developing countries. It is, however, only poorly adopted among rural voters. Does the use of biometric technology in the conduct of elections reconstruct rural voters' behaviour, amid prevailing social challenges? The links between these realities and their consequences are currently less understood, and lacking in supporting literature. I argue that the public perception of biometric technology, the availability of proper infrastructure, and the distance between polling stations and the dwellings of rural voters all affect the latter's level of adoption of biometric technology. These interactions combine to produce specific modalities that shape voting behaviour and general political culture. I elicit primary data from voters in Nigeria's remote villages, so as to predict the implications and consequences of glossing over the dimensions and magnitude of the biometric technology adaptation challenge by policymakers. I conclude by reflecting on how these interplays and interactions create "spatial differentials" in electoral outcomes/credibility, and proffer possible strategies for institutional intervention.

AB Purpose The agribusiness sector has long been acknowledged as a major source of livelihood to many people in developing countries. Hence, determining the resources and capabilities influencing farm-level competitive advantage are vital to better understand and formulate appropriate strategies to increase the competitiveness ofminor export crops farms. This study aims to understand of the link between resources-capabilities-competitive advantage for appropriate measures to be recommended to enhance the competitive position of the smallholding farms.
   Design/methodology/approach This study adopts the resource-based view in combination with dynamic capabilities. The scope comprises owners of farms who possess experience in commercial cultivation of minor export crops in Sri Lanka. A self-administrated structured questionnaire was used to collect data.
   Findings Based on the responses from 456 farm owners, results of the multiple regression analysis indicate that variables representing resources such as human assets, physical assets, financial assets, institutional capital, collective action and entrepreneurial identity; and dynamic capabilities such as organisational learning, relationship building, quality management and marketing are significantly associated with competitive advantage of the minor export crops farms. Reputation and farm process management capability are the only two insignificant variables. Taken together, the resources and dynamic capabilities investigated explain 89.3 per cent of the variation in competitive advantage, in which 82 per cent is contributed by resources.
   Originality/value The findings provide useful insights not only in terms of understanding the link between resources, dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage but also how resources and capabilities can be channelled and leveraged to bring about competitive advantage to the minor export crops farms. Theoretical and practical implications as well as future research directions are provided.

AB Development projects in Madagascar have increased and evolved for half a century, yet they have failed to enhance farmers' performances. Related literature attributes the causes of failure as external to the project instigators, who are mostly institutions and funders. This article aims to highlight the role of development agents and their responsibility in unsuccessful projects. Participant observation of participatory learning and action research conducted in the Malagasy highlands revealed that non-consideration of the target audience's rationale makes the innovation processes provided by development projects obsolete.

TI Asymmetric Open Government Data (OGD) framework in India
SO DIGITAL POLICY REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE
LA English
DT Article

AB Purpose With the ongoing drives towards Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives across the globe, governments have been keen on pursuing their OGD policies to ensure transparency, collaboration and efficiency in administration. As a developing country, India has recently adopted the OGD policy (www.data.gov.in); however, the percolation of this policy in the States has remained slow. This paper aims to underpin the asymmetry in OGD framework as far as the Indian States are concerned. Besides, the study also assesses the contribution of Open Citizens in furthering the OGD initiatives of the country.
   Design/methodology/approach An exploratory qualitative following a case study approach informs the present study using documentary analysis where evidentiary support from five Indian States (Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Sikkim and Gujarat) is being drawn to assess the nature and scope of the OGD framework. Further, conceptualization for Open Citizen framework is provided to emphasize upon the need to have aware, informed and pro-active citizens to spearhead the OGD initiatives in the country.
   Findings While the National OGD portal has a substantial number of data sets across different sectors, the States are lagging behind in the adoption and implementation of OGD policies, and while Telangana and Sikkim have been the frontrunners in adoption of OGD policies in a rudimentary manner, others are yet to catch up with them. Further, there is asymmetry in terms of the individual contribution of the government bodies to the open data sets where some government bodies are more reluctant to share their datasets than the others.
   Practical implications It is the conclusion of the study that governments need to institutionalize the OGD framework in the country, and all the States should appreciate the requirement of adopting a robust OGD policy for furthering transparency, collaboration and efficiency in administration.
   Social implications As an Open Citizen, it behooves upon the citizens to be pro-active and contribute towards the open data sets which would go a long way in deriving social and economic value out of these data sets.
   Originality/value While there are many studies on OGD in the West, studies focused upon the developing countries are starkly lacking. This study plugs this gap by attempting a comparative analysis of the OGD frameworks across Indian States. Besides, the study has provided a conceptualization of Open Citizen (OGD) which may be tapped for further research in developing and developed countries to ascertain the linkage between OGD and OC.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to simultaneously test the association between three different sources of knowledge (internal, collaborative and regional) and innovation. This study aims to expand the insights by assessing these associations in the context of a rapidly developing and liberalizing economy; Vietnam. By conducting this study with Vietnamese data, the authors can assess whether the association between different sources of knowledge and innovation shows systematic differences to those in advanced economies.
   Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors utilize data from two main sources: The World Bank Enterprise Survey and the Innovation Capabilities Survey. These firm-level surveys comprise non-agricultural formal and private sector firms. For Vietnam, 300 manufacturing firms have been included in the sample. The authors use a series of binary logistic regression models to analyze the data.
   Findings The analyses reveal that internal R&D has a strong positive association with product innovation. In contrast to findings in Western economies, not all kinds of collaborative knowledge sources have a significant association with innovation. Only collaborative knowledge gained from inside the supply chain is positively related to product innovation. Unexpectedly, negative effects from using too much external knowledge were also found.
   Research limitations/implications Due to the cross-sectional nature of the data causality could not be inferred from the study. Moreover, a relatively large number of the measures were dichotomous due the large number of missing observations for more detailed measurements of the variables.
   Practical implications When developing their innovation strategy firms in developing countries should take into account that collaborating with partners useful, but only if they collaborate within the supply chain. As such, firms should increase their interaction with suppliers and customers and put their efforts on the development of customized solutions for them.
   Social implications The Vietnamese Government could implement policies that help to enhance the quality of universities and research institutes. In most developed countries, universities and research institutes are vital sources of knowledge for innovation whereas they are not in Vietnam.
   Originality/value This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on firm-level innovation in developing countries. It identifies several core differences between the drivers of innovation in developed and developing contexts. Surprisingly, a feature that was expected to differ, the negative effect of over-search of external knowledge on innovation, was also found in Vietnam.

AB The contribution of African researchers to knowledge by means of scientific publications is low compared to other regions of the world. This paper presents an argument in favour of PhD by publication as a tool for innovation and technology transfer. The conception of PhD by publication used in this study is more suited for doctorates in science and technology. Building on the literature on the key role of a knowledge economy in 21st-century development and catch-up processes, we argue that: (a) in order for PhD dissertations to be more useful to society, they should be harmonised with scientific publications which centre on improving the design and quality of existing and new products in developing countries; (b) obtaining a doctorate degree should not simply be reduced to a change in candidate's title; and (c) the PhD by publication is a more effective route to ensuring that the contribution to knowledge is widely disseminated. The conceptual framework consists primarily of the clarification of the models of PhD by publication and the linkages between the doctoral education, innovation, technology transfer and development catch-up. Implications for scientific research policies in the light of contemporary challenges to African development are discussed.

AB Industrial clusters in developing countries exhibit the properties of labour intensive, low-tech and low-cost manufacturing hubs in the global production networks. This research argues that institutional architecture of global production networks provides an opportunity to these industrial clusters of developing countries to create value through 'knowledge links' between the firms and non-firms actors of global production networks and innovation systems (ISs) in which the clustered firms are embedded. The research develops a hypothesis for a potential upgrading of industrial cluster firms through the support of knowledge institutes embedded in the network structures of regional innovation systems, national innovation systems and global production networks. The conceptual-theoretical framework is designed by connecting the cluster theory, innovation system framework and global production networks theory for an assessment of the upgrading of developing countries industrial clusters within global production networks. From an institutional perspective, this research classifies the knowledge links as `technological-knowledge' and 'organisational-knowledge' links between the firm and non-firms actors of global production networks and innovation systems. A further future research can empirically test this designed framework through data of the industrial clusters firms, participating in the global production networks.

AB The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationships between supply chain relationships/integration, innovative capabilities and manufacturing performance. The study adopts Institutional Theory and Resource-Based View Theory to assess relationships in 171 organisations drawn from three rapidly developing countries - Brazil, India and China. Data were collected using the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS VI) and analysed using structural equation modelling. The study found that supply chain relationships and integration relate positively to both product and process innovative capabilities. The study also found that both product and process innovative capabilities relate positively to manufacturing performance. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between product innovative capabilities and process innovative capabilities. The findings provide new insights into manufacturers in the three countries and show that the relationships they build with their customers have encouraged them to develop new innovative capabilities. These new capabilities, in turn, have enabled them to reap benefits of improved manufacturing performance.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the curvilinear effects of firm innovativeness (i.e. product, organisational and marketing innovation) on international expansion as well as the effect of expansion on performance in the developing countries (DCs) setting.
   Design/methodology/approach Research hypotheses are tested using survey data obtained from firms located in four South-East European DCs. Covariance-based structural equation modelling is used to test the proposed conceptual framework.
   Findings Empirical findings support the hypothesised U-shaped relationship between product innovation and organisational innovation and the level of international expansion of firms in developing markets. The authors found an inverse U-shaped relationship between marketing innovation and the level of international expansion. Furthermore, the existence of a strong positive link between the level of international expansion and firm performance is also confirmed.
   Research limitations/implications While this research utilises a sample of firms from a homogenous group of DCs, further research could use a more heterogeneous sample and thus control the model for various contingency effects (e.g. environment turbulence, market structure and competitive dynamics).
   Practical implications When it comes to product and organisational innovation, international expansion is achieved only with a higher level of innovativeness. On the contrary, beyond a certain level, further investments in marketing innovation do not have additional positive effects on international expansion.
   Originality/value This study is one of the first that explicitly focuses on examining the non-linear effects of innovativeness on international expansion in the DC context.

AB Inclusive higher education is elusive for students with disabilities, especially in developing countries. The adoption and rapid ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) provides, if applied as its drafters intended, a "whole of institution" framework for its realization (CRPD Committee, 2016). Myriad legal, attitudinal, physical, and communication-based barriers limit or exclude participation. The individual impact of such discrimination is clear and carries lifelong consequences. Equally endemic are the broad societal and pedagogical effects of this exclusion. To illustrate: preventing persons with disabilities from Teacher Education courses impacts inclusive education in primary and secondary education; barring people with disabilities from academic programs in the sciences stifles innovation in assistive technology, health, and rehabilitation; and limiting access to studying the humanities hampers the emergence of disability studies as a rightful discipline. This article presents a framework for inclusive higher education in developing countries as contemplated by the CRPD. In doing so, we draw on field work conducting the first assessment of the accessibility of Egyptian public higher education to students with disabilities. We outline lessons that can be learned and pitfalls to be avoided both in Egypt and indeed for other countries in the Global South.

AB Purpose This paper aims to explore the barriers that constrain the venture capital (VC) financing in Iran based on the institutional theory.
   Design/methodology/approach To answer the question, How institutional barriers constrain the VC financing in Iran?, 31 detailed interviews were conducted, and the interviewed data were analysed by using the grounded theory method.
   Findings There exist several institutional barriers (formal and informal) in different stages of the VC investment process in Iran. Major formal institutional deficiencies include lack of appropriate financial regulations, inefficacy in tax, labour, property rights, financial disclosure, bankruptcy, investor's protection laws and regulations, lack of credit rating/scoring system, inefficacy in small and medium-sized enterprise-supporting policies and capital market underdevelopment. Moreover, there exist some informal institutional barriers such as culture of capitalism disapproval, culture of secrecy, individualistic customs and weakness of managerial skills that constrain VC activities in Iran.
   Research limitations/implications The research findings imply that the government's role should change from establishment of government-sponsored VC funds to enforcement of institutional reforms that lead to an appropriate framework for VC investment.
   Originality/value This paper has made three key contributions. First, it has provided comprehensive insights into how institutional barriers constrain the VC investment in a developing country. Second, a new stage-wise model is proposed for analysing the VC investment process. Third, existing knowledge about the role of both formal and informal institutions in the VC investment is extended.

SO JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING

   inequalities

AB Purpose Ethiopia operates a large agricultural extension service system. However, access to extension-related knowledge, technologies and agricultural inputs is unequally distributed among smallholder farmers. Social learning is widely practiced by most farmers to cope with this unequal distribution though its practices have hardly been documented in passing on knowledge of agriculture and rural development or embedding it into the local system of knowledge production, transfer and use. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to identify the different methods of social learning, as well as their contribution to the adoption and diffusion of technologies within Ethiopia's smallholder agricultural setting.
   Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods approach was used, comprising farmer and expert interviews, focus group discussions, informal individual discussions and key informant interviews. The data were documented, coded and later analyzed using SPSS and ATLAS.ti.
   Findings The findings showed that 55 per cent of the farmers in the studied areas fully relied on social, community-level learning to adopt agricultural technologies, while 35 per cent of them relied on social learning only partly. Farmers acquired knowledge through social networks by means of communication, observation, collective labor groups, public meetings, socio-cultural events and group socialization. Informal institutions such as iddir, debo and dado, helped farmers learn, adopt and diffuse technologies.
   Originality/value This study used the concept of epistemic oppression by Dotson (2014) as a conceptual framework to examine farmers' access to extension services and to analyze how informal institutions serve as workplace learning for the smallholder farmers. The authors suggest community-level social learning serves as a coping mechanism against the prevailing limitations of the formal extension system, and at the same time, it guards against the deepening of social, political and epistemic inequalities that are inherent to the knowledge system.

AB In recent decades, multinational corporations (MNC) have increasingly penetrated bottom of the pyramid (BOP) markets due to globalization and market liberalization. To gain legitimacy within these markets, MNCs have employed corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategies. This paper focuses on how BOP consumers perceive the CSR strategies of advanced country MNCs (AMNCs). Specifically, this study examines how BOP consumers' admiration of economically developed countries (AEDC) influence CSR strategy success in BOP markets. In doing so, this paper contributes to the literature on BOP strategies and BOP consumer psychology. With a sample of consumers from Madagascar, the results provide evidence that AEDC is a relevant construct that firms from developed countries should consider when implementing consumer-oriented strategies in BOP markets.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the relationship between some management features (management capability, management entrenchment, agency costs and overconfidence) and the innovation of companies listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange.
   Design/methodology/approach The study carried out during 2009-2015. A total of 125 companies were selected from eight industries as the sample of study using the method of systematic elimination. A descriptive-correlational design was used in this study and panel data regression models were employed for developing the relationship between research variables.
   Findings The obtained results indicated that managerial ability could foster innovation, while managerial entrenchment could stifle innovation and agency costs and overconfidence have no effect on innovation.
   Originality/value The current study is almost the first project which focuses on the management characteristics and firm innovation in developing countries.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish a more robust empirical support for the long established postulation by Adam Smith and Joseph Schumpeter that human capital and institutions enable Schumpeterian entrepreneurship, which, in turn, facilitates economic growth.
   Design/methodology/approach Adopting entrepreneurial orientation (EO) (i.e. innovativeness, proactiveness and risk taking; Mthanti and Ojah, 2017, Research Policy, 46:4, pp. 724-739) as the measure of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship at the macro-level, and using a sample of 93 countries, over 1980-2008, the authors employ system Generalised Method of Moments to investigate institutions and human capital as possible determinants of Schumpeterian entrepreneurship (EO).
   Findings The authors find that the human capital-EO nexus is robust across economic development levels. However, there is a cross-country variation in the institutions-EO nexus. In line with theoretical predictions, institutions indeed drive EO in middle-to-high-income countries. However, in low-income countries, building institutions in order to foster EO yields perverse outcomes, which, for us and especially based on deeper analysis, suggest that improving the quality of institutions may not be a necessary precondition for EO/growth policy in low-income countries. Furthermore, the authors find that EO is a highly persistent series, with self-reinforcing network effects, i.e. lofty EO behaviour encourages more lofty EO behaviour.
   Research limitations/implications Drivers of macro EO are erroneously taken as of growth. This empirical analysis corrects the sequencing.
   Practical implications Policy practice must acknowledge macro-EO importantly has both direct and indirect growth effects.
   Originality/value This study is the first to empirically test the theoretical sequence between drivers of growth/EO and economic growth.

AB Purpose: The limited uptake of improved agricultural practices in Africa raise questions on the functionality of current agricultural research systems. Our purpose is to explore the capacity for local innovation within the research systems of Ethiopia, Malawi and Mozambique.
   Design/methodology/approach: Using Conservation Agriculture (CA) as a case study, we qualitatively explore with 26 locally based agricultural researchers the context of CA research and promotion, including their perceptions on persistent research gaps and issues in closing them.
   Findings: Respondents identified that CA was not yet a finished product, with concerns regarding the benefit, feasibility and relevance of CA implementation. They asserted that while further adaptation was required, they were unable to do this due to institutional constraints within their research, extension and policy contexts.
   Practical implications: We find that CA continues to be considered a donor-driven intervention in its current form and requires substantial further adaptation to local contexts before researchers will deem it ready for farmer uptake. The five research gaps identified by respondents highlight practical areas where further adaptations must occur.
   Theoretical implications: Our findings suggest a lack of participatory research and extension most likely reflects limited financial, human and social capital to implement more participatory approaches. Without addressing these capacities, widespread adoption of complex farming systems change appears unlikely.
   Originality/Value: Whilst many studies have identified a need for local innovation to enable CA utilisation, few have qualitatively explored directly with local researchers the capacity of such systems to do so. We address this gap in the literature.

ID DISTANCE EDUCATION
AB With the growing demand for tertiary education, especially in Africa, the transformation of contact universities to dual-mode institutions is critical. However, conventional universities have had limited success establishing the dual-mode delivery stream. This paper assesses barriers to adoption and implementation of open and distance learning (ODL) in conventional higher education institutions in Cameroon, Kenya and Rwanda by applying a framework on innovation adoption to case studies of ODL in higher education in these countries. This qualitative meta-study shows that the transition to dual-mode is not systematic and that there are various barriers, ranging from national policy and funding; infrastructure, organisational structure and capacity; complexity and cost of ODL; as well as student and staff skills and perceptions, which have impeded adoption. Based on the findings, this paper makes recommendations for implementing ODL in existing conventional universities. Cases of successful transition to dual-mode are provided.

AB To effectively address the root causes of carbon lock-in across developing countries, Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) with transformational change characteristics are being supported by donors and finance mechanisms as a means to achieve ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs). However, there is still a scarcity of empirical studies on how transformational change policies and actions are designed and supported in practice. This article addresses such a gap in knowledge by combining theoretical insights from the multi-level perspective and transitions management literature to examine a donor-supported cement sector NAMA in Tunisia developed during 2012-2013. A narrative is constructed to analyse the adequacy of the NAMA design to promote structural shifts towards low carbon development in the cement sector. Data collection is based on semi-structured interviews and documentation gathered during field work in Tunisia 2014-2015. The study finds that the NAMA design is not likely to lead to transformational change of the cement sector, since underlying factors accounting for lock-in are not properly tackled. Although the NAMA has enabled new and promising sectoral partnerships across the cement sector, the analysis suggests that the NAMA's transformational potential is currently limited by a number of factors not being adequately addressed. Measures are proposed to reorient the NAMA towards promoting system innovation, building on further research and experimentation with the policy entrepreneurial role of donors.Key policy insights Underlying factors such as the absence of local finance institutions and the lack of reflexivity features in project design restrict the potential of the Tunisian cement NAMA to spur transformation to low carbon development.To tackle underlying causes of carbon lock-in and reorient policies and actions for transformational design, the promotion of feedback loops and self-contemplation needs to be based on a long-term vision, experimentation, social learning and information gathered during implementation.Donors need to re-think their existing modalities to better support unpredictable and highly political changes for sustainability transitions in developing countries.

AB Purpose - This study aims to examine consumer perception of introduction of Islamic banking (IB) in Ghana, which is a new and emerging form of banking in many non-Islamic countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - Empirical field data were collected from a sample of 975 respondents using self-administered structured questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was conducted using SPSS version 16.
   Findings - Muslim respondents have significantly positive perceptions of IB compared to non-Muslims and have stronger intentions to adopt IB in Ghana than non-Muslims. Non-Muslims have high perceived benefit of IB. Non-Muslim respondents do not perceive potential threat of violence associated with the introduction of IB in Ghana. Although non-Muslims perceive IB that would make Islam popular, they do not perceive it as a means of Islamizing bank customers. Relatively, non-Muslims appear to have low knowledge of IB, unfavourable attitude towards IB, are reluctant to comply with Sharia law and consequently have weaker intentions to adopt IB.
   Research limitations/implications - This study was limited to descriptive analysis and to only Ghana. Future research should quantitatively model IB adoption and switching factors using samples from other developing countries.
   Practical implications - IB institutions could focus on attracting a niche of Muslim consumers at its initial stages. Moreover, to facilitate the introduction of IB, the Bank of Ghana and other relevant stakeholders, in addition to establishing effective governance structures, must promote consumer education to enhance consumer knowledge of IB and correct misconceptions about IB among consumers, particularly non-Muslim customers.
   Originality/value - One unique contribution of this study is that it provides an initial empirical exploration of consumers' attitude and perceptions of IB in Ghana, which is an under-researched area.

AB Community Renewable Energy (CRE) has been defying conventional energy systems for decades, though only recently it started to feature in academic and institutional discourses. Despite its new appeal, the literature on the impacts and factors influencing CRE projects is still scarce and builds mostly on studies in Europe and North America. In developing countries, where electricity access is low and energy poverty is prevalent, CRE can offer interesting opportunities for rural electrification and added benefits. The objective of this study is to assess the impacts of community-owned renewable energy projects and identify the internal and external drivers and barriers to their success. An exploratory case-study approach was used for collecting data, through interviews and observations, in two community micro-hydro projects in Indonesia. The results showed positive socio-economic impacts that exceed electrification benefits, and the reported success of community energy projects can be traced back to a combination of community-level as well as external factors. Yet, particularly important is the role of the intermediary organisation (Ibeka) in building communities' ownership, enhancing (technical, entrepreneurial and managerial) capacities, transferring knowledge and technology, establishing innovative financing models and shaping policy. Such organisations are critical in bridging external and internal factors and thus represent a key element in integrating the proposed analytical frameworks.

AB Namibia, like many southern African countries, aims to become a knowledge-based society with a well-established innovation system (IS). Development based on knowledge and innovation reduces poverty and inequality, even if this causality is also contested. In this study, we analyzed the development of an IS in Namibia with a particular focus on indigenous knowledge (IK). Embedding IK in innovation policies is often seen as an opportunity to adjust the general concept of ISs to local contexts and practices and include bottom-up approaches in policies. In Namibia, the establishment of key institutions and strategies for an IS is supported by international development aid. In operational IS practices, the focus is on a science-technology-innovation mode of learning that requires high analytical knowledge and a well-functioning IS - which are rare in Namibia. The results of our study reveal that the doing-using-interacting mode of learning and IK create comparative advantages and provide ability for positive societal change in the local communities. However, despite high expectations, the practical outcomes of innovations based on IK are limited. Nevertheless, beyond its economic value, IK is important for developing countries' innovation policy development, as it can facilitate the participatory processes of local communities in the establishment of ISs.

AB This paper examines frugal innovations as processes, products and systems that affect the resource constraints that are typical for many developing countries. The focus is on the impacts of mobile phone technology-induced frugal innovations' on the resource constraints and how these influence productivity, public services provision and inclusiveness. The effects are illustrated with the help of the case of the M-Pesa payment system and more specifically two particular services that use M-Pesa, i.e. Kilimo-Salama, an agricultural microinsurance through mobile phones and M-Farm, market access services for small farmers. The results reveal positive impacts on private sector productivity and public services provisions due to, among others, reduction of transaction length and hence costs. With regard to inclusiveness it is likely that in the short term the application of IT-induced frugal innovations will not be inclusive. In the longer term the inclusiveness of these innovations can be expected to increase.

AB The aim of this study is to explore a proposition of eco-innovation internet-based approach to bridge the gap between market orientation and marketing performance of the batik SMEs in Indonesia. Batik is an Indonesian art of waxed hand painting on the textile by utilizing of natural dyes. The 250 questionnaires were distributed among the SMEs actors; however, 189 out of 250 questionnaires were valid to be further processed. This research has provided some empirical evidence that the approach of e-eco-innovation has a significant impact on marketing performance. Furthermore, market orientation also has a significant impact on both marketing performance and e-eco-innovation. Therefore, the adoption of ICT (Internet & Communication Technology) and eco-innovation may contribute not only to the body of knowledge of green marketing but also for the practice of green marketing amongst SMEs in developing countries.

TI The analysis of entry of Ethiopian enterprises into the export-markets
   and the associated factors: The duration approach
SO JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT

AB Purpose Though many studies in the past dealt with the survival and growth of enterprises both in the local- and export-markets, less attention was given to the analysis of the duration of enterprises entry into the export-markets. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to analyze the duration of Ethiopian enterprises entry into the export-markets.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper used data collected from 848 enterprises through a cross-sectional survey method conducted by the World Bank in 2015. In order to estimate the average duration - the time that enterprises need to wait before entering into the export-markets and the associated factors - the authors used the mixture of non-parametric (Kaplan-Meier) and parametric (Weibull) models.
   Findings The non-parametric results show that enterprises are required to wait for an average of about eight years before entering into the export-markets after their establishment. In addition, foreign-owned enterprises were found to be faster in entering into the export-markets than their domestically owned counterparts. The parametric results revealed that enterprises' product innovation, enterprises' size and age, and custom and trade regulations are factors that curtail the durations of enterprises entry into the export-markets. On the other hand, enterprises' operational costs, the size of enterprises' locality, and enterprises' location are factors that slow the durations of enterprises' entry into the export-markets.
   Originality/value This study is the first to offer pioneering evidences on the duration (time in years) that Ethiopian enterprises need to wait before entering into the export-markets and the factors that affect the length of their waiting time.

TI The Sierra Leone rare earth minerals landscape: An old or new frontier?
SO EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Sierra Leone; Mining; Rare earth minerals; Governance
AB The rare earth mineral industry in Sierra Leone is touted as a new frontier with ongoing exploration and exploitation of "new deposits". However, a review of Sierra Leone's historical mining development reveals not only that knowledge of the occurrence of rare earth mineral deposits date back to the early 20th century when the British colonial government established a geological survey and mines department, but also that the history of this industry cannot be described in linear and progressive terms. New "discoveries" have followed the trends of the international markets of commodities, the invention of instruments and machines for detecting and processing rare earth minerals, civil and military technological demands and innovations, as well as historical changes in global economic and political scenarios. We examine some of the processes by which rare earth minerals have become, at different times throughout the development of Sierra Leone's mining industry, part of mutable "resource environments". Using archival research of mainly government documents we argue that the Sierra Leone colonial government, British institutions and mining companies collaborated in the formulation of policies and laws that "created" and, at the same time, secured such strategic minerals for superpowers, largely to the disadvantage of Sierra Leone.

AB This paper presents a case for enterprise architecture (EA) and IT governance for driving techno-organizational change and coordination of health information systems (HISs) in developing countries. We support our claim with analyses of a large-scale electronic HIS in Ethiopia by tracing the logic of actors' decisions and conduct within and beyond the organizational boundaries of the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health to understand how the information system innovation process is designed, legitimized and imposed by internal and external organizational forces. In the absence of formalized institutional arrangements throughout the HIS development and implementation, an international development agency fills a key gap forming an obligatory passage point which we conceptualize as the dam effect. Drawing on actor-network theory, we identify three important implications of EA and IT governance: (1) to help achieve an alignment of interests within the enterprise; (2) to serve as a tool for protecting the interests of the enterprise in external negotiations; and (3) to serve as a pragmatic approach to carrying out techno-organizational change.

AB This article analyses recent World Bank interventions aimed at improving higher education and local research capacity in low-income countries. Our empirical entry point is a critical analysis of the Development and Innovation Grant (DIG) scheme the Bank rolled out in Cambodia (2010-2015), a virtual carbon copy export of its Academic Initiative Fund in Bangladesh. Offering a rare insider perspective, we argue that the DIG scheme ultimately failed because the Bank so glaringly misunderstood the Cambodian context. We use this case to contemplate the deeper flaws in how the Bank thinks', highlighting how the world's most powerful development institution manages to maintain faith in its own infallibility despite failure.

DE Uganda; Governance; Value chain; Gross margins; Multi-stakeholder

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that agricultural commodity value chain development using multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) can fast-track improvement in the livelihoods of rural farming households. With the view that such partnerships can raise farmers' incomes, the study uses the case of the organic pineapple (OP) value chain in Ntungamo, Western Uganda, to understand the governance features that hold the value chain partners together, to analyse the costs and margins to the participating farmers, to identify opportunities for demand-driven upgrading of the farmers' skills and knowledge, and the role that partnerships play in such upgrading.
   Design/methodology/approach The study uses the qualitative tools of value chain analysis: value chain maps of stakeholders, processes and support services of the OP value chain, and a quantitative tool to analyse costs and margins to the participating farmers. Interviews were conducted with key informants from the OP innovation platform, and survey data collected for the planting season, February-July, 2014, across three farmer categories of certified organic, conventional, and farmers not participating in the innovation platform.
   Findings Careful selection of partnerships to develop the value chain is found to be critical. Partners to involve should be those that enable the upgrading of farmers' knowledge, skills and technologies to position them for better markets. Partners should also include those that enable the improvement of margins to the farmers and efficiency of the value chain. The strategic MSPs should be bound by formal contracts, to ensure stable relationships in the value chain and hence sustainable market access for the farmers.
   Research limitations/implications Although carried out on a specific value chain in a specific local context, this is not likely to limit the applicability of the findings to commodity value chains in a range of local contexts.
   Originality/value The study fulfils the need to highlight the role that stakeholder partnerships can play in value chain development and how they can be sustained by governance and institutional arrangements.

AB This paper reports on an examination of the impact of knowledge sharing on product and process innovation. In it we try to identify the similarities and differences between these impacts in public and private Higher Education (HE) Institutions in Iraq. A mixed methods approach was conducted using 486 valid responses to test the causal relationships between knowledge sharing, and innovation. Then a qualitative approach was used to give more insight of the findings from the quantitative stage regarding the differences in the effect of the studied relationships. Employing structural equation modelling, the research found that knowledge sharing plays a pivotal role in enhancing innovation in both sectors. The multi-group SEM and the interviews revealed differences between Iraqi public and private HEIs. Guidelines are developed for researchers as well as leaders, and evidence support using knowledge sharing to enhance innovation within HE in developing countries. The findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.

TI The production and use of indicators in science, technology and

SO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Malawi; South Africa; Policymaking in Africa; Production of STI
   indicators; Science technology and innovation indicators; Use of STI

AB Purpose A growing number of African countries are starting to produce science, technology and innovation (STI) indicators. The purpose of this paper is to provide some lessons learnt in the production and use of STI indicators in Malawi and South Africa. It is compares the two countries' efforts to conduct Research and Development (R&D) surveys and examines whether and how STI indicators are used in policymaking processes.
   Design/methodology/approach The study approach is qualitative. The research methodology encompasses a thorough review of both policy and academic literature as well as some interviews.
   Findings The study demonstrates that South Africa has a relatively developed institutional arrangement for undertaking R&D and innovation surveys and developing related STI indicators. There is evidence that efforts are being made to use STI indicators to inform policymaking in the country. On the other hand, Malawi conducted its first R&D survey under the African Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators Initiative (ASTII) and has not established an institutional mechanism dedicated to producing STI indicators. There is no evidence that indicators are used in, or to inform, policymaking in the country.
   Research limitations/implications Because of significant differences in STI policymaking histories, capacities and cultures of the two countries, it is not really useful to compare the STI production and use. Rather it is important to draw lessons from the efforts of the two countries.
   Practical implications The results suggest that the production of STI indicators should be embedded in policy processes. To be useful and effective, STI indicators production needs to be explicitly linked to policy formulation, evaluation and monitoring activities without necessarily undermining the independence of producing STI indicators.
   Social implications Creating stand-alone programmes or agencies for R&D and innovation surveys without clear articulation with policymaking needs erodes opportunities of having evidence-based STI policy regimes.
   Originality/value Although in 2005 only South Africa and Tunisia had national programmes dedicated to the generation of R&D statistics, by the end of 2010 at least 19 African countries had experimented with conducting R&D surveys under the auspices of the ASTII of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. These countries accumulated different experiences and consequently build different kinds of institutional capacities. Through the Malawi and South Africa case studies, some important lessons for STI indicators production and use and STI policymaking can be drawn for developing countries in general and African countries in particular.

AB Organic farming and genetically modified (GM) crops technologies are currently being promoted as alternatives to conventional farming that is seen as unsustainable. However, institutional constraints can impede the adoption of even the most sustainable technology. This paper analysed the effect of institutional factors on farmers' adoption of conventional, organic and GM cotton in Burkina Faso. Building on the expected utility model and institutional theory, a multinomial logistic regression was performed using farmers' survey data from the 2014-2015 production season. The results showed that subsidies on fertiliser and credit for cereals production, the power of farmers' association and that of the cotton company favoured the adoption of conventional and GM cotton at the expense of organic cotton. In order to succeed, organic cotton projects need to include components that help farmers to access organic fertilisers for cereals production. They also need to involve the cotton companies that are the most powerful stakeholders of the cotton sector. Extension services are necessary for both organic and GM cotton adoption. Other important factors to consider include farmers' education, the potentials of the technologies, the good agro-ecological conditions, the continued involvement of women, the availability of virgin lands and the closeness of farmers to their farms.

AB Technical change is a major driving force for economic growth and development, thus technological change and innovations could be a powerful process that opens up opportunities to increase social welfare and benefits for societies. Whether opportunities turn into real benefits and allow for broad participation depends on a number of factors. In this contribution, we focus on three questions. First, what are the drivers of and the gains from technological change? Second, is there broad participation in the gains from technological change? Third, what mechanisms generate asymmetric participation or even non-participation? Reviewing the literature, we obtain two sets of answers, one set for developed countries (DCs) and one for less developed countries (LDCs). This contribution links up to the article Innovations, Growth and Participation in Advanced Economies - A Review of Major Concepts and Findings (published in the previous issue of IEEP) in which the process of innovation as well as the effects of technological change on growth and distribution has already been discussed for advanced economies. In this contribution, the focus is on developing economies. Technology that originated in DCs is transferred to LDCs. We identify the channels of technological transfer that allow LDCs to potentially participate in the benefits. Here, the development of the modern sector with links to international value chains plays a major role. However, global diffusion of technology and its gains are very diverse. Reasons for this diverse participation in gains include power structures in global value chains combined with an excess supply of labor and the malfunctioning of local governments and institutions in LDCs.

AB Background: Results-based financing (RBF) is emerging as a new alternative to finance health systems in many African countries. In Mali, a pilot project was conducted to improve demand and supply of health services through financing performance in targeted services. No study has explored the sustainability process of such a project in Africa. This study's objectives were to understand the project's sustainability process and to assess its level of sustainability.
   Methods: Sustainability was examined through its different determinants, phases, levels and contexts. These were explored using qualitative interviews to discern, via critical events, stakeholders' ideas regarding the project's sustainability. Data collection sites were chosen with the participation of different stakeholders, based on a variety of criteria (rural/urban settings, level of participation, RBF participants still present, etc.). Forty-nine stakeholders were then interviewed in six community health centres and two referral health centres (from 11/12/15 to 08/03/16), including health practitioners, administrators, and those involved in implementing and conceptualizing the program (government and NGOs). A theme analysis was done with the software (c) QDA Miner according to the study's conceptual framework.
   Results: The results of this project show a weak level of sustainability due to many factors. While some gains could be sustained (ex.: investments in long-term resources, high compatibility of values and codes, adapted design to the implementations contexts, etc.) other intended benefits could not (ex.: end of investments, lack of shared cultural artefacts around RBF, loss of different tasks and procedures, need of more ownership of the project by the local stakeholders). A lack of sustainability planning was observed, and few critical events were associated to phases of sustainability.
   Conclusions: While this RBF project aimed at increasing health agents' motivation through different mechanisms (supervision, investments, incentives, etc.), these results raise questions on what types of motivation could be more stable and what could be the place of local stakeholders in the project; all this with the aim of more sustained and efficient results.

TI Understanding uptake of an intervention to accelerate antiretroviral
   therapy initiation in Uganda via qualitative inquiry
SO JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY

AB Introduction: The Streamlined Antiretroviral Therapy Initiation Strategy (START-ART) study found that a theory-based intervention using opinion leaders to inform and coach health care providers about the risks of treatment delay, provision of point of care (POC) CD4 testing machines (PIMA) and reputational incentives, led to rapid rise in ART initiation. We used qualitative research methods to explore mechanisms of provider behaviour change.
   Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 24 health care providers and nine study staff to understand perceptions, attitudes and the context of changes in ART initiation practices. Analyses were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework.
   Results: Rapid dissemination of new practices was enabled in the environmental context of an existing relationship based on communication, implementation and accountability between Makerere University Joint AIDS Program (MJAP), a Ugandan University-affiliated organization that provided technical oversight for HIV service delivery at the health facilities where the intervention was implemented, and a network of health facilities operated by the Uganda Ministry of Health. Coaching carried out by field coordinators from MJAP strengthened influence and informal accountability for carrying out the intervention. Frontline health workers held a pre-existing strong sense of professional identity. They were proud of attainment of new knowledge and skills and gratified by providing what they perceived to be higher quality care. Peer counsellors, who were not explicitly targeted in the intervention design, effectively substituted some functions of health care providers; as role models for successful ART uptake, they played a crucial role in creating demand for rapid ART initiation through interactions with patients. Point of care (POC) CD4 testing enabled immediate action and relieved providers from frustrations of lost or delayed laboratory results, and led to higher patient satisfaction (due to reduced costs because of ability to initiate ART right away, requiring fewer return trips to clinic).
   Conclusions: Qualitative data revealed that a multicomponent intervention to change provider behaviour succeeded in the context of strong institutional and individual relationships between a University-affiliated organization, government facilities, and peer health workers (who acted as a crucial link between stakeholders) and the community. Fostering stable institutional relationships between institutional actors (non-governmental organization (NGOs) and ministry-operated facilities) as well as between facilities and the community (through peer health workers) can enhance uptake of innovations targeting the HIV cascade in similar clinical settings.

TI Do R & D tax incentives work? Firm-level evidence from China

AB Tax incentives have been used worldwide to encourage firm R & D, but there is little evidence on their effectiveness as a policy tool in developing countries. We use a panel dataset of Chinese listed companies covering 2007 to 2013 to assess the effects of tax incentives on firm R & D expenditures and analyze how institutional conditions shape these effects. Our results show that tax incentives motivate R & D expenditures for our sample firms. A 10% reduction in R & D user costs leads firms to increase R & D expenditures by 3.97% in the short run. We also find considerable effect heterogeneity: Tax incentives significantly stimulate R & D in private firms but have little influence on state-owned enterprises' R & D expenditures. Moreover, the effects of tax incentives are more pronounced for private firms without political connections. Hence, reducing political intervention complements tax incentives' capacity to foster firm R & D in developing countries.

AB Meeting global climate change mitigation goals requires the participation of developing countries in abatement programs to encourage low-carbon development pathways. Incentivizing developing countries to participate in climate change mitigation often requires a mechanism for developed countries to finance projects in poorer countries. While several funding institutions have been established, African country participation has been low. In this analysis, we conduct interviews with climate change policy stakeholders from across the continent and find a general consensus that a lack of institutional capacity has limited the participation of African countries in existing climate change mitigation programs. To confirm this qualitative observation, we use data from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank to examine the correlation between country-year measures of institutional capacity and the number of projects implemented by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and find that better institutional quality is associated with more GEF projects implemented in a country-year. We propose to address the lack of institutional capacity with the creation of regional institution, or Climate Change Mitigation Institution (CCMI), that specializes in building local capacity by leveraging external capacity as well as facilitates the integration of African countries into global climate change mitigation efforts by improving capacity, strengthening research and development, forming partnerships, and coordinating the disbursement of financing.

AB The BRICS countries in general, and China and India in particular, are now widely regarded as the areas of the world likely to challenge the economic leadership of the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). A large part of this challenge will come from rapid technological catch-up by China and India. Yet, despite a recent rise in interest, there is limited knowledge about how and where innovation takes place in these two leading emerging countries and to what extent the Chinese and Indian territorial systems of innovation differ from those in the EU or the US. In this article we explore the geography of innovation in China and India, concentrating on understanding key territorial-level innovation trends by country, region and technology field, using the US and the EU as benchmarks. We find significant contrasts between the geography of innovation in China and India and that of the US and the EU. First, the degree of concentration of innovative activities in both countries is extremely high. Levels of agglomeration of innovation in the coastal provinces of China, as well as in Delhi and the South of India, significantly exceed the levels of agglomeration found in the USA and the EU. Secondly, China has witnessed a more rapid increase in the degree of concentration of innovation than India. We posit that the differences in the geography of innovation between, on the one hand, China and India and, on the other hand, between these countries and the developed world are rooted in different institutional settings, different systems of innovation and different national innovation strategies.

ID COMMUNITY-HEALTH WORKERS; ESSENTIAL MEDICINES
AB Background: Supply chain bottlenecks that prevent community health workers (CHWs) from accessing essential medicines significantly increase under-5 child mortality, particularly in poor and rural areas.
   Objective: Using implementation research, interventions aimed at improving supply chain practices and access to medicines were tested in Malawi and Rwanda. These interventions included simple demand-based resupply procedures, using mobile technology and traditional methods for communication, and multilevel, performance-driven quality improvement (QI) teams.
   Methods: Mixed-method evaluations were conducted at baseline (2010), midline (2013), and endline (2014). Baseline assessments identified common bottlenecks and established performance levels. Midline assessments identified which intervention package had the greatest impact. Endline surveys measured the progress of scale-up and institutionalization of each innovation.
   Results: In both Rwanda and Malawi CHWs, health center staff, and district managers all cited many benefits of the establishment of resupply procedures and QI teams: such as providing structure and processes, a means to analyze and discuss problems and enhance collaboration between staff.
   Conclusions: Implementing simple, streamlined, demand-based resupply procedures formed the basis for informed and regular resupply, and increased the visibility of appropriate and timely community logistics data. QI teams played a critical role in reinforcing resupply procedures and routinely unlocking the bottlenecks that prevent the continuous flow of critical health products. While simple, streamlined, demand-based resupply procedures provide the basis for regular, functional, and efficient resupply of CHWs, the procedures alone are not sufficient to create consistent change in product availability. Supporting these procedures with multilevel QI teams reinforces the correct and consistent use of resupply procedures. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Governments around the world seek to design policies that enhance the innovative capacity of public service. Hence, identifying the underlying meanings attributed to innovation concepts in public policies is critical, as these very understandings inform not only the policy discourses, but also the overall institutional landscape regulating innovation activities. This paper examines such fundamental definitional aspects in the specific context of the National Health Service in England. For this purpose, it traces the evolution of the innovation concept in policy discourse based on the analysis of 21 key policy documents published or commissioned by the English Department of Health between 1948 and 2015. Systematic analysis of these texts reveals that policymakers' conception of healthcare innovation broadened considerably over time. English health innovation policy initially focused on basic biomedical research. Subsequently, it entered a transitional period, zeroing in on science- and technology-based innovation. Finally, this focus gradually shifted to a broader conception of innovation translating into health, economic, and service design benefits. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Scholars from the diverse academic themes have reflected and discussed the connection between the innovation and the geographical settings. In developing countries, like India, high technology cluster development is not a new phenomenon, and has been a significant tool for policy implications. However, such clusters have emerged in certain regions, specifically southern India, endowed with diverse set of 'knowledge bases/knowledge communities', which are being utilized at different stages of the innovation. Among the clusters in southern India, Bengaluru biocluster is an important example to reflect upon various dimensions of the regional innovation system. The presence of some of the premier research institutions, Indian and foreign multinationals, skilled workforce, backed by robust policy initiatives, provides Bengaluru an edge over other clusters located in other parts of the country. With this prelude, the study attempts to explore different knowledge communities and innovation dynamics in the Bengaluru biocluster, which is influenced, inter alia, by the global waves of innovation. A mixed method is adopted along with a case study approach to examine the given cluster. Moreover, the study infers that knowledge communities enjoy linkages at the local, regional and global levels; leading to expansion of cluster. Evidently, publications and patents outputs as well as collaborating activities have an inter-relation with innovation process.

AB The relationship between corporate environmental performance and corporate financial performance has been extensively studied in developed countries, and has received less attention in developing countries. For this reason, the main objective of this paper is to examine the effect of corporate environmental performance on corporate financial performance during a global financial crisis, depending on the economic development level of the country where a firm is located. To this end, we obtain data for a sample of 2982 large firms from 2008 to 2015. We apply Petersen's approach to these data, adjusting the standard errors for clustering by both firm and year. The results obtained show that the adoption of environmental practices significantly and positively affects the corporate financial performance in developed and developing countries. However, this effect is stronger for firms located in developing countries than those located in developed countries.

AB Introducing water harvesting technology is expected to be more effective and last longer if farm households are involved in their design. The main objective of this study is to inform policymakers in Ethiopia about the most important terms and conditions to incentivize farmers to enter into a contractual agreement to invest in water harvesting on their land. In order to test the influence of the way the specific contractual terms and conditions are communicated to farm households, many of whom are illiterate, a split sample approach is applied with and without visual aids for technical, institutional, and economic contract characteristics. Both samples generate significantly different results, highlighting the importance of how information is conveyed to farm households. This pattern is confirmed when examining the self-reported importance attached to the various contract characteristics. Equality Constrained Latent Class models show that contract characteristics for which visual aids were developed are considered more attentively, emphasizing the importance of adequate communication tools in a developing country context where literacy rates are limited to increase water technology innovation uptake and reduce farm household vulnerability to droughts.
   Plain Language Summary Diffusion of new water harvesting technology will be more effective if farm households are involved in their design. Terms and conditions to incentivize farmers to invest in water harvesting technology are identified. Contract characteristics for which visual aids were developed are considered more attentively. Accounting for literacy in communication and outreach supports effective uptake of water harvesting technology.

AB The aim is to assess the impact of YouTube videos about academic writing and its skills on the writing performance of students. Theoretical perspectives from constructivism and associated learning models are used to inform the purpose of the research. The contextual setting is matriculation students awaiting admission to higher institutions. The population is 40 students belonging to a class aimed at assisting disadvantaged students in their academic writing in Scottsville, Province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The students are broken into two groups control/traditional teaching and the treatment/YouTube facilitated groups. Consequently, a dominant qualitative approach is adopted using focus group discussion, interviews and tests to identify underlying patterns, methods and approaches to best fit academic writing guides and videos to improve user experiences of the media for academic writing. The fundamental results show that positive characterisations of user experiences include innovation, surprise, playfulness and stimulation whereas the narratives that are not satisfying are categorised as dissatisfaction, frustration, dissolution, disappointment, anger, confusion and irritation. Ultimately, the major findings of the research have the potential to improve user experiences on the platform by highlighting how and when the positive and negative experiences of users occur and a mapping of the differences in the academic writing performance between the two groups and best practices. Finally, the results have implications for pedagogy - the fitting of YouTube videos to academic writing instruction.

TI A Process Evaluation to Assess Contextual Factors Associated With the
   Uptake of a Rapid Response Service to Support Health Systems'
   Decision-Making in Uganda

AB Background: Although proven feasible, rapid response services (RRSs) to support urgent decision and policymaking are still a fairly new and innovative strategy in several health systems, more especially in low-income countries. There are several information gaps about these RRSs that exist including the factors that make them work in different contexts and in addition what affects their uptake by potential end users.
   Methods: We used a case study employing process evaluation methods to determine what contextual factors affect the utilization of a RRS in Uganda. We held in-depth interviews with researchers, knowledge translation (KT) specialists and policy-makers from several research and policy-making institutions in Uganda's health sector. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis to develop categories and themes about activities and structures under given program components that affected uptake of the service.
   Results: We identified several factors under three themes that have both overlapping relations and also reinforcing loops amplifying each other: Internal factors (those factors that were identified as over which the RRS had full [or almost full] control); external factors (factors over which the service had only partial influence, a second party holds part of this influence); and environmental factors (factors over which the service had no or only remote control if at all). Internal factors were the design of the service and resources available for it, while the external factors were the service's visibility, integrity and relationships. Environmental factors were political will and health system policy and decision-making infrastructure.
   Conclusion: For health systems practitioners considering RRSs, knowing what factors will affect uptake and therefore modifying them within their contexts is important to ensure efficient use and successful utilization of the mechanisms.

AB Understanding the publication output of a country's biomedical research can provide information for strengthening its policies, economy, and educational systems. Yet, this is the first bibliometric study to date to analyze and provide an in-depth discussion of the biomedical research productivity from Libyan academic institutions. The biomedical research productivity of higher education institutes and affiliated hospitals from Libya, with a focus on the higher education sector, was analyzed and discussed for the period of 2003-13 using the PubMed database. A questionnaire online survey was also developed to obtain opinions of Libyan scientists on productivity status and quality of research output. A total of 345 peer-reviewed articles were included in the analysis and were authored by researchers in the cities of Benghazi (32%), Tripoli (29%), Al-Zawiya (9%), Al-Bayda (8%), Sabha (3%), Misrata (3%), and Al-Khoms (1%). The papers included co-authors and/or corresponding authors from over 40 other countries were published in 179 journals covering a broad range of biomedical topics. Questionnaire (44% response rate) indicated research is largely self-funded. Information along with accurate, comprehensive, and transparent metrics can be applied to aid governmental and nongovernmental institutions to develop stable infrastructures for academic communities to achieve effective research performance and innovation.

AB Drawing on the contemporary turn to discursive practices we examine how the organizing practices of industry, university and government facilitate (or impede) developing countries transition to a hybrid triple helix model of innovation. Placing emphasis on the everyday situated practices of institutional agents, their interactions, and collaborative relationships, we identified three domains of practices (advanced research capabilities and external partnerships, the quantification of scientific knowledge and outputs, and collective entrepreneurship) that constitutively facilitate (or impede) partnership and in turn the successful transition to a hybrid triple helix model. Our study also highlights the contextual influence of differential schemata of interpretations on how to organize innovation by the three institutional actors in developing countries.

AB Institutional barriers and constraints in developing countries require new supply chain models where economic, social and ecological aspects are integrated. Sustainable supply chain management discourse has focused on ecological aspects and neglected social issues, while Base of the Pyramid studies have neglected ecological considerations. This study links the sustainable supply chain management discourse with insights from Base of the Pyramid studies in order to suggest an integrated sustainability perspective. This work adopts a multiple case study design based on secondary data analysis in order to investigate supply chain concepts of 18 successful products and develop sustainable supply chain models in the areas of sourcing, making and delivering. Findings suggest that by employing localized and simplified approaches, companies targeting low-income markets can overcome existing local institutional barriers. We conclude that employing simplified and localized approaches to supply chains and simultaneously integrating local communities in the value creation activities can serve as success factors. Therefore, by linking sustainable supply chain with the Base of the Pyramid strategies discourse, we fill an important research gap in the literature. From a practitioner's perspective, the derived supply chain models serve as best practices for managers of multi-national companies, local entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations and political institutions designing, operating and regulating supply chains for low-income markets.

AB The declining availability of grazing land and the increasing prices of commercial dairy feed threaten the sustainability of traditional smallholder livestock farmer (SLF) practices across sub-Saharan Africa. Fodder tree technology (FTT), an agroforestry approach that entails the cultivation of multipurpose fodder trees on farmlands, could help address such challenges. However, the adoption rate of FTT has been low, especially in Malawi, where dairy processing plants usually operate at 20% capacity and milk consumption is less than half the African average. This paper investigates the role of 20 possible determinants of FTT adoption. It uses binary logistic regression to analyze primary data collected through two extensive household surveys conducted during the Agroforestry Food Security Program (AFSP) in different regions of Malawi. This data is complemented with qualitative information extracted through in-depth interviews with SLF. The general lack of knowledge regarding FTT was identified as the largest constraint to adoption. It was further confounded by other factors such as the lack of market access, inconsistent emphasis of training organizations during extension efforts, gender disparities, poor land quality, and issues of land tenure. The "extension environment" created by the AFSP influenced the perceptions of SLF for some adoption determinants. In particular it reduced the influence of sociological and geographic factors such as relationships with lead farmers, and shifted financial focus from the cost and availability of inputs, to the means of capitalizing on outputs (such as market access). This improved FTT adoption by 53% overall. Some suggestions for future extension efforts on how to improve the perceptions of the expected utility of FTT include the careful evaluation of farmer-led extension models, assurance of seed supply, and the consideration of institutional/sociological factors in project design. Examples of such factors include divorce rates, conflicts between formal and customary laws/rules, and infrastructure.

AB This article examines how patent protection in developing countries affects the technology licensing strategy of US multinational firms and the associated technology transfer flows. Strengthening patent rights lowers appropriability hazards and so reduces the firms' reliance on affiliated licensing as the more secure means of transfer (the internalization effect). However lower appropriability hazards also encourage the firms to increase the volume of technology transfer via licensing both within and outside the firm (the appropriability effect). Which effect prevails depends on the underlying technological complexity of the firms' product. We find that a strengthening of patent protection in the host country increases the incentive to license innovations to unaffiliated parties. While unaffiliated licensing rises among all firms, the volume of affiliated licensing falls among complex-technology firms but rises among simple-technology firms. The positive appropriability effect on affiliated licensing is strong enough among simple-technology firms that the entire composition of their licensing further shifts towards affiliated parties. The results are significant for recent work on the internalization theories of multinational firms and the interaction between firm strategy and the institutional environment, as well as for patent policy in the developing world, where access to knowledge is critical.

AB Research impact and its measurement are of increasing importance. This is particularly significant for agricultural science, which is expected to produce solutions to future challenges that will arise from population growth, climate change and ecosystem degradation. Much econometric effort has been devoted to analysis of investment in agricultural research and its effects on farm productivity. This analysis, reviewed here, has produced a consensus suggesting that returns are high, although they are achieved only after long lags. However, policy-makers perceive the occurrence of impacts as too few, and poorly targeted with respect to their needs. An attribution gap between the outcomes of agricultural research and how they reach farmers has motivated evaluation of the process of transmission and translation of agricultural research outputs into ultimate impacts. This gap can be narrowed by Participatory Impact Pathway Analysis, implemented mostly so far in low income countries. However, it is a costly and cognitively complex approach. Content analysis of the UK's 2014 REF Impact Case Studies uncovers the mind set of researchers and their managers regarding the description of impact and how it is supposed to occur. This reveals a nascent conservatism that focuses on research that can be shown to have impact, rather than research impact itself. From the overall discussion it can be concluded that the impact evaluation of agricultural science raises more profound issues than simply efficiency or transparency. Confirmation bias threatens impact evaluation, principally by distracting from other important stories about how and why the ultimate effects occur, but also by transforming the nature of the process itself. Methodological pluralism, with greater integration and triangulation between different evaluation approaches, is a promising means of resolving these problems.

AB It has been suggested that as medicine advances and mortality declines, socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes will grow. Yet, most research on this topic uses data from affluent Western democracies, where mortality is declining in small increments. We argue that the Global South represents the ideal setting to study this issue in a context of rapid mortality decline. We evaluate two competing hypotheses: (1) there is a trade-off between population health and health inequality such that reductions in under-five mortality are linked to higher levels of social inequality in health; and (2) institutional interventions that improve under-five mortality, like the expansion of educational systems and public health expenditure, are associated with reductions in inequalities. We test these hypotheses using data on 1,369,050 births in 34 low-income countries in the Demographic and Health Surveys from 1995 to 2012. The results show little evidence of a health-for-equality trade-off and instead support the institutional hypothesis.

AB This paper aims to understand how and why institutional barriers constrain digitalization of government budgeting in a developing country context. E-Government studies that specifically focus on public sector budgeting as a cross-agency activity remain limited. While the dominant research focus has been on government interactions with citizens and businesses, budgeting as a significant cross-agency process is yet to receive the necessary research attention. To address this gap, this study employed institutional theory as the analytical lens and qualitative, interpretive case study as the methodology to investigate a government budgeting digitalization project and related challenges in the developing country context of Ghana. The findings show that outdated laws and the culture of paper document flows were institutional barriers to the budgeting digitalization. Other barriers included non-use of an integrated system implementation approach as well as inadequate and unreliable online access for all the participating units. The originality of the paper lies in its focus on government budgeting as a significant e-government research phenomenon.

AB Using a new comprehensive database of 75 countries spanning 2004-2013, we examine the joint effects of research and development (R&D) intensity and competition on the value-creation of a firm. We introduce country-specific institutional characteristics related to institutional quality, R&D infrastructure and training and test whether these variations change the effect of R&D intensity on firm value. Moreover, we calculate the marginal effect of R&D intensity on firm value for high and low-income countries separately, based on different degrees of competition. Our findings suggest that in developing countries the positive effect of R&D intensity on the market valuation of a firm exists primarily for firms in less competitive industries. In developed countries, however, the positive effect of R&D intensity on Tobin's Q is evident for all competition levels. The results are empirically robust after controlling for potential endogeneity and employing alternative country-level attributes. Our findings have strong policy implications based on differences in R&D related investments made by firms in developing and developed countries.

AB This aim of this study is to identify elements in the institutional setting which affect technological learning outcomes in large socio technical systems. By drawing on fieldwork and empirical evidence from Iran's oil and gas industry, a multiple-case study has been conducted. It is found that the institutional regime of this sector jeopardizes technological learning scenarios through 4 overarching aspects: Cost, Time, Risk and Management structure, which we call "the CTRM square". It is also revealed that the locked-in institutional structure of the sector creates a "negative co-evolution" among actors leading to impairment of technological learning. Our data shows that the characteristics of large socio-technical regimes in developing countries act in favour of such impairment. These regimes create strong commitment in stakeholder groups. Such commitment establishes dominancy around technological routines, which is the result of low absorptive capacity of stakeholders and their lack of awareness regarding new technological scenarios. In some cases, political conditions surrounding a project as well as personal gains lead to the stakeholder's deliberate action against a new technological scenario. The negative co-evolution contributes to the supply side change of strategy in order to safeguard their market position which ultimately engenders dominancy of obsolete technological routines in the firms diminishing technological learning in the oil and gas industry.

AB The Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL) celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary in 2014. Since then, REAL has become one of the leading research centers of regional science worldwide. In this article, we describe the scholarly network involving REAL's alumni working in academia in Brazil. We analyze the patterns of research collaboration among around fifty Brazilian researchers whose main activities are related to academic institutions in Brazil. The Brazilian REAL network has shown to be an interesting case study that reflects the pattern of evolving collaboration networks in scientifically emerging economies. The expansion of the REAL scientific collaboration network in Brazil emerges as a relevant mechanism for both a qualitative leap in national scientific production in regional science and for the dissemination of knowledge in peripheral regions of the country. Conducted under the leadership of Geoffrey J. D. Hewings, it has helped to develop regional science in the country still further. This case study serves as an example of knowledge diffusion and of the role played by key researchers in the evolution of this network, providing a contribution to the science of research and innovation.

AB While it is clear that hospitals in developing countries need to improve quality of health services and improve patient safety, hospitals in high resource countries need to do the same. Most often the focus on improvement through institutional health partnerships involves hospital teams from high resource settings attempting to aid and teach hospital staff in low resource settings, particularly in Africa. However these efforts to provide assistance may be more satisfying and sustainable if we understand that partnership learning is bi-directionalwhere by hospital teams from high resource settings also benefit. One particular partnership-based model that demonstrates this benefit to high resource partners is the World Health Organization African Partnerships for Patient Safety (APPS). Johns Hopkins Medicine Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety & Quality (AI) through the APPS model has co-created twinning partnerships with hospitals in Uganda, South Sudan & Liberia. This commentary aims to deconstruct specific learnings that have benefited the Johns Hopkins AI community through the APPS partnership.

AB Background: Using reliable information from routine health information systems over time is an important aid to improving health outcomes, tackling disparities, enhancing efficiency, and encouraging innovation. In Ethiopia, routine health information utilization for enhancing performance is poor among health workers, especially at the peripheral levels of health facilities. Therefore, this study aimed to assess routine health information system utilization and associated factors among health workers at government health institutions in East Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted at government health institutions of East Gojjam Zone, Northwest Ethiopia from April to May, 2013. A total of 668 health workers were selected from government health institutions, using the cluster sampling technique. Data collected using a standard structured and self-administered questionnaire and an observational checklist were cleaned, coded, and entered into Epi-info version 3.5.3, and transferred into SPSS version 20 for further statistical analysis. Variables with a p-value of less than 0.05 at multiple logistic regression analysis were considered statistically significant factors for the utilization of routine health information systems.
   Results: The study revealed that 45.8% of the health workers had a good level of routine health information utilization. HMIS training [AOR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.60, 4.62], good data analysis skills [AOR = 6.40, 95% CI: 3.93, 10.37], supervision [AOR = 2.60, 95% CI: 1.42, 4.75], regular feedback [AOR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.38, 3.51], and favorable attitude towards health information utilization [AOR = 2.85, 95% CI: 1.78, 4.54] were found significantly associated with a good level of routine health information utilization.
   Conclusion: More than half of the health workers working at government health institutions of East Gojjam were poor health information users compared with the findings of others studies. HMIS training, data analysis skills, supervision, regular feedback, and favorable attitude were factors related to routine health information system utilization. Therefore, a comprehensive training, supportive supervision, and regular feedback are highly recommended for improving routine health information utilization among health workers at government health facilities.

TI THE ROLE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN ENHANCING FOOD SECURITY IN ARAB
   COUNTRIES
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Food insecurity; Factors; Arab Countries; Science and Technology
AB The Arab world is the largest food deficit region in the world due to the major challenges facing increasing food production despite the high potential to increase agriculture production in most Arab countries. In 2013 the Arab world imported 85.6 million tons of cereals compared to 65.3 million tons for Asia, the second largest food importer. Several factors are behind the food deficit in the Arab world including water scarcity and very low water use efficiency; serious climate change implications including more frequent droughts and high temperature; desertification or land degradation due to excessive grazing, loss biodiversity and salinity due to faulty irrigation and sea water intrusion. Political instability is another important factor that contributed to widening the gap between domestic food production and consumption. However, these challenges can be overcome through innovations in science and technology can help in growth in sustainable food production and improve food security without depleting natural resources. This paper describes some of these innovations, developed jointly by national research institutions in collaboration with the International Center for Agricultural Research Dry Areas (ICARDA) and other partners. These include improved, adapted crop varieties with high yield potential and resistance/tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses; appropriate water management and more efficient water use; diversification and sustainable intensification of production systems which increase the returns to water and land used and reduce the risk associated with variable climatic environments. The paper provides on the ground examples in several Arab countries on bridging the yield gap between farmers yield levels of wheat and the levels of improved wheat production levels following improved varieties and agronomic practices. In an average of six seasons (2010/2011-2015/2016) involving whole provinces in nine Arab countries, wheat productivity yield gap was increased up to 124% under irrigated conditions in Sudan, up to 96% under supplemental irrigation in Yemen and up to 84% under rainfed conditions in Syria. Increasing wheat productivity and production contributes to enhancing food security in Arab countries.

AB We investigate the relation between the introduction of innovation and subsequent firm growth employing a dataset representative of the Chilean productive structure. By means of quantile treatment effects (QTE), we estimate the effect of the introduction of innovation by comparing firms with a similar propensity to innovate for different quantiles of the firm growth distribution. Our results indicate that process innovation positively affects sales growth for those firms located at the 75th and 90th percentiles. Contrarily, product innovation appears not to be a driver of firm performance. We also find that process innovation benefits mature firms at higher quantiles while it positively affects young firms located at low-medium quantiles.

Financial development boosts innovation by improving resource allocation and investment in strategic sectors as well as facilitating technology to promote growth. Using binary response models and instrumental variable techniques to correct for endogeneity, we find robust but puzzling results. Contrary to most of the existing literature, financial development has a negative effect on the probability of a firm to innovate in developing countries. This effect is conditional on firm size, and only larger firms benefit from financial development. These results are robust to different measures of financial development and econometric specifications. We argue that this is a result of the design of the financial system in regard to the lack of capital and institutional system. Consequently, developing countries should first generate appropriate institutional conditions if they want financial development to spur growth through innovation.

AB Background: Malawi is a low-income country with one of the highest HIV prevalence rates worldwide (Kendig et al., Trop Med Health 41: 163-170, 2013). The health system depends largely on external funding. Official German development aid has supported health care in Malawi for many years (German Embassy Lilongwe, The German Development Cooperation in Malawi), including placing medical doctors in various departments of the Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in Lilongwe. In 2008, a hospital partnership called MAGNET (Malawi German Networking for Capacity Building in Treatment, Training and Research at KCH) evolved as part of the German ESTHER network. The partnership was abruptly terminated in 2015.
   Methods: We reviewed 35 partnership documents and conducted an online survey of partnership stakeholders to retrospectively assess the hospital partnership based on the Capacity WORKS model of the German Corporation for International Cooperation (GIZ). This model evaluates systems' management and implementation to understand and support the functioning of cooperation within societies. Based on this model, we considered the five success factors for cooperation management: (1) strategy, (2) cooperation, (3) steering, (4) processes, and (5) learning and innovation. In an online survey, we used an adapted version of the partnership evaluation tool by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
   Results: From 2008 to 2015, the MAGNET partnership contributed to capacity building and improved patient care in the KCH Medical Department through clinical care, technical support, teaching and trainings, and operations research based on mutually agreed upon objectives. The MAGNET partnership was implemented in three phases during which there were changes in leadership in the Medical Department and the hospital, contractual policies, funder priorities and the competing influences of other actors. Communication and follow up among partners worked best during phases when a German doctor was onsite. The partnership was judged as a positive driver for change and support within the Medical Department, but eventually failed to implement self-sustainable, robust processes within the partnership to cope with multiple changes and challenges.
   Conclusion: The MAGNET partnership made a considerable contribution to patient care, continuous medical education and operations research at KCH, despite its abrupt termination. Changes in the institutional infrastructure, donor policy and interpersonal relations contributed to the loss of shared expectations and the end of the project. Institutional-hospital partnerships, like MAGNET, can make a valuable contribution to health care provision and hence a wider health agenda, provided there is a flexible, mutually agreed upon strategy, personal commitment, continuous communication and robust processes. However, partnership projects remain vulnerable to the influences of external actors and structures. Ministries of Health and donor agencies should appreciate the particular strength of hospital partnerships.

ID COST-EFFECTIVENESS
AB The World Health Organization estimates a global deficit of about 12.9 million skilled health professionals (midwives, nurses, and physicians) by 2035. These shortages limit the ability of countries, particularly resource constrained countries, to deliver basic health care, to respond to emerging and more complex needs, and to teach, graduate, and retain their future health professionals a vicious cycle that is perpetuated and has profound implications for health security. The Global Health Service Partnership (GHSP) is a unique collaboration between the Peace Corps, President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, Seed and host-country institutions, which aims to strengthen the breadth and quality of medical and nursing education and care delivery in places with dire shortages of health professionals. Nurse and physician educators are seconded to host institutions to serve as visiting faculty alongside their local colleagues. They serve for 1 year with many staying longer. Educational and clinical best practices are shared, emphasis is placed on integration of theory and practice across the academic clinical domains and the teaching and learning environment is expanded to include implementation science and dissemination of locally tailored and sustainable practice innovations. In the first 3 years (2013-2016) GHSP placed 97 nurse and physician educators in three countries (Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda). These educators have taught 454 courses and workshops to 8,321 trainees, faculty members, and practicing health professionals across the curriculum and in myriad specialties. Mixed-methods evaluation included key stakeholder interviews with host institution faculty and students who indicate that the addition of GHSP enhanced clinical teaching (quality and breadth) resulting in improved clinical skills, confidence, and ability to connect theory to practice and critical thinking. The outputs and outcomes from four exemplars which focus on the translation of evidence to practice through implementation science are included. Findings from the first 3 years of GHSP suggest that an innovative, locally tailored and culturally appropriate multi-country academic-clinical partnership program that addresses national health priorities is feasible and generated new knowledge and best practices relevant to capacity building for nursing and medical education. This in turn has implications for improving the health of populations who suffer a disproportionate burden of global disease.

AB This paper discusses external influences on innovation platforms(IPs) and the options for effective responses. The platforms examined in this paper were conceived as vehicles for facilitating institutional change in support of innovation that benefits smallholders, in selected agro-enterprise domains in Benin, Ghana and Mali. They were designed and implemented in a manner that enabled experimentation with processes of change in the selected domains. A Research Associate in each case facilitated the work of the IPs and applied Theory-Guided Process Tracing (TGPT) methodology to document the innovation processes pursued by platform members. The recorded data allow analysis of the external influences on the IPs. This paper first presents a typology as derived from literature of the main external influences on the domains of interest, and then uses the typology to analyse the influences on and responses of the IPs. The main influences were found to emanate from global, sub-regional and national levels. The IPs' responses were diverse but generally included reconstitution of the membership, lobbying, capacity-building among smallholders, and empowerment of smallholders by organizing provision of new knowledge, skills or financial resources. The paper highlights lessons drawn by the platform members in addressing the challenges involved. It concludes that external influences are important in determining the direction of socio-technical and institutional innovation.

AB In the Office du Niger large rice farming irrigation scheme in Mali, water management has been a permanent source of tension between the smallholder tenants and the administration. The transfer of tertiary canal maintenance to the tenant farmers was expected to improve water management but, in practice, that rather led to deterioration. An innovation platform, erected by the CoS-SIS (Convergence of Sciences - Strengthening Innovation Systems) Program, reached a consensual agreement to transfer the maintenance of tertiary canals to the tenant producers, and updated the Contrat Plan expropriation rules for failure to pay water fees as well as many other key dispositions ruling duties and responsibilities for all parties: farmers, Office du Niger agents and the State.

TI Achieving energy savings by intelligent transportation systems
   investments in the context of smart cities
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Energy savings; ITS; Smart cities; Smart mobility
ID CITY; IMPACTS; DEMAND
AB Investments in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are beginning to take place in the context of smart city initiatives in many cities. Energy efficiency and emissions reduction are becoming essential rationales for such investments. It is important, therefore, to understand under what conditions investments in ITS in the context of smart cities produce energy savings. We reviewed existing literature, conducted case studies and interviews, and found that the smart cities context has transformed traditional ITS into "smart mobility" with three major characteristics: people-centric, data-driven, and powered by bottom up innovations.
   We argue that there are four main steps for smart mobility solutions to achieve energy savings and that several institutional, technical, and physical conditions are required at each step. Energy savings are achieved when users change their behavior and result in less travel, modal shift, and reduction of per-km energy consumption in the short term. Smart mobility solutions also enable other energy saving policies or initiatives, which would otherwise not be feasible. In the long term, users' lifestyles could change and lead to further energy savings.
   For cities in developing countries with lower motorization, less-developed infrastructure, less financial resources, and less institutional and technical capacity, our recommendations to achieve benefits from smart mobility investments are: (1) involve all public and private players in a collaborative and transparent setting; (2) develop the technical capacity to procure and monitor information services; and (3) focus on basic infrastructure, including a coherent road network and basic traffic management measures.

AB Creative class refers to the demographic segment composed of intellectuals, knowledge intensive workers and artists in different fields. Creative class is of essential social significance in that its members are capable of booming regional economy through innovation. Rather few studies have empirically examined the neighborhood social determinants of intra-urban creative class concentrations (CCCs), especially in the developing countries. Using the case of Shanghai city in China, this paper characterizes the CCCs in relation to social tolerance and life quality supportive conditions (LQSCs) at district level. Data for CCCs are collected from Shanghai's Population Census (2010) at the district level. A set of social diversity indices (ethnic, education, income, marriage status, and birth place) are used as proxy for tolerance and LQSCs are described by a set of indicators from 8 domains (job chance, medical care, educational facilities, commutation, food resources, housing, leisure, and natural amenities). Multivariable linear regression is employed to identify the determinants of CCCs. Results show that both neighborhood social tolerance and LQSCs have significant influences on different categories of CCCs. In particular, creative class is attracted by the neighborhoods that are open and welcoming to the outsiders. In addition, creative class emphasizes accessible medical care, traveling convenience, elementary education institution, great housing choices, and more natural amenities in their neighborhood. The variance decomposition method demonstrates that neighborhood LQSC determinants are more important for the intellectuals, knowledge workers and total CCCs. For the artists, the neighborhood social tolerance determinants are more influential. Our study generates a set of neighborhood social indicators to understand the intra-urban CCCs.

AB Massingir district is located in southern Mozambique, bordering South Africa. From the mid-2000s onwards, foreign private and domestic investments in the district have been on the rise in the agribusiness, tourism, and conservation sectors. This has resulted in events that scholars and activists have come to describe as land, water, and green grabs. The on-going discussions have urged the government to fully implement the policy and legal frameworks that oblige investors to undertake community consultations based on the principle of Free and Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) and to safeguard the communities' land right acquisition. However, little has been clarified about how the consulted communities actually have experienced the consequences of their consent after they agreed to resettle or to concede parts of their communally managed land to investors. This article elaborates on a case study of a community resettled from the Limpopo National Park in Massingir and the neighboring community, which, after struggling to secure land and to improve their livelihood, began to reflect on their initial consent, interact with various actors, and craft strategies for expressing dissent and re-negotiating the deal they had struck. The article argues that the current emphasis on consultation for the purposes of building consent overlooks the importance of paying systemic attention to these strategies that are emerging from the community's everyday experiences with the consequences of their act of giving consent. Inclusive land governance entails an institutional mechanism that closely responds to people's experiences with policy practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims to determine whether the dichotomy between the science, technology, and innovation policy based on neoclassical and evolutionary schools of economics is applicable to developing countries. Regarding the fundamental differences in foundations of these two economic paradigms, policymakers have been forced to select and to follow one of the two seemingly competing views. However, in developing countries, due to various market and government coordination failures, complying with one of the schools has not been successful in practice. From the past, there has been some controversy between neoclassical and evolutionary schools on the subject of science, technology and innovation policy. Using a survey questionnaire and statistical analyses of the results, this paper shows that, due to the institutional setting and structural conditions in developing countries, despite the fundamentally different foundations of the competing schools of thought, the policy implications of the schools have converged. Drawing on Theme Analysis Method, the rationales are first conceptualized and then the fuzzy method is applied to reveal the respondents' tendency to the extracted rationales and implications of the two competing schools. In conclusion, the statistical results validate the proposed hypothesis.

AB There have been several studies on E-Commerce adoption in developing countries. However, few have investigated least developed countries (LDCs). Of those that have, their findings tend to be descriptive in nature - falling short of a theoretical contribution grounded in the socioculttral context. The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical analysis of E-Commerce adoption in an LDC, Tanzania. Specifically, the study seeks to identify structural practices associated with E-Commerce in Tanzanian SMEs. Using structuration theory and following an interpretivist stance the findings show that Tanzanian SMEs enact three major E-Commerce structural practices: (1) Marketing and image-building through use of websites, (2) Transacting through extensive use of mobile technology (3) Technical problem-solving through establishing partnerships. These practices are informed by organisational and enVironmental factors that define the sociocultural, technological and economic contextual setting. Considerable evidence is found that SMEs use websites in a limited way, as they draw upon their understanding of websites as being incompatible with the Tanzanian cultural bargaining system, which is characterised by cash transactions and face to face bargaining. Websites are viewed primarily as a platform from which SMEs can portray a sophisticated image and advertise/market their products. SMEs use mobile technology extensively, as they draw on the technology's ability to offer transactive capability, mobility and communication. Findings also point to technological challenges which SMEs face from the environment, mainly from a lack of supporting industry and institutional support. SMEs hence establish partnerships with international organisations that can support them in overcoming technological challenges. Partnerships with large ICf organisations require stringent conditions, such as the requirement for SMEs to have certification in order to be affiliated. The study gives practitioners a better understanding of how SMEs perceive E-Commerce in Tanzania amidst organisational and environmental opportunities and constraints, and in so doing practitioners can better design appropriate E-Commerce context-specific policies and interventions that address SME problems. This will ensure that available resources become utilised in a more effective manner without negative consequences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI OPERATIONALIZING AN INNOVATION PLATFORM APPROACH FOR COMMUNITY-BASED
   PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH ON CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE IN BURKINA FASO
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS; FARMS
AB Numerous innovation platforms have been implemented to encourage the adoption of agricultural innovations and stakeholder interactions within a value chain. Yet little research has been undertaken on the design and implementation of innovation platforms focussing on issues other than market access and aiming to encourage agro-ecological intensification. This is the case for the development of Conservation Agriculture (CA) in West Africa, which due to its complex nature calls for technical, organizational and institutional changes at the level of both production systems and village territories. This article analyses the design and implementation process of platforms in three villages in Burkina Faso aiming to develop CA technical references with local stakeholders, and to renew rules of interaction between stakeholders within a territory. The platforms enabled farmers in the three villages to actively participate in the identification of the cropping systems that were tested and to improve their knowledge and mastery of CA. They furthermore promoted networking among producers and facilitated the development of new rules for crop residue use. The platforms thus appear to be relevant mechanisms, enabling complex innovations to be addressed. Diverse modifications and improvements are discussed that would ensure the sustainability of the platforms and the evolution of their objectives and activities beyond those of the project under which they were launched.

AB Due to many differences in presumptions and theoretical foundations within neoclassical and evolutionary economics, policy-makers are always confronted with the dilemma of selecting one of these two central models for technology and innovation policy. In light of widely institutionalised ineffectiveness in the field of market and systematic coordination - in Iran as well many other countries - the present investigation presumes that reliance on any of the above doctrines alone is ineffective. An intermediate concept of policy rationales to achieve a comparative structure of policy implications is proposed. Policy rationales (in innovation and technological policy) for neoclassical and evolutionary economics were derived based on a thematic analysis. A spectrum of policy implications of both doctrines was designed and completed in the form of a questionnaire for, together with theoretical foundations and policy rationales by specialists of the field of innovative and technological policy in Iran. Given the institutional conditions and structural frameworks which actually exist, and in spite of wide dissimilarities within the theoretical foundations of neoclassical and evolutionary economics, Clustering of respondents and subsequent test trials show that policy implications of the economics doctrines in the field of innovative and technological policy in Iran are complementary and convergent.

AB This paper reviews the literature on firm innovation performance from 1995 until 2016. The empirical literature on this topic has been growing continuously over the last few decades. Previous research has investigated the explanatory variables and their impact on firm innovativeness separately. The present systematic review brings together all explanatory variables explored in the literature, classified according to their direction of causality and impact on innovation. These are represented in a comprehensive framework that includes three major research streams: internal, external and contextual indicators, and examines how they influence the innovative capabilities of firms. In addition to this re-examination, the study shows that the majority of these variables are inter-linked with other variables in explaining the relationship with innovation, which is represented in a comprehensive theoretical model. The aim of this review is to draw a general picture of the standing of the research on innovation performance, specifically in areas where unanimous results have already been achieved, and to highlight the opportunities for future research.

AB Combating poverty is a priority for developing countries. The program "Technology Foresight Initiative in Latina America" initiated by UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) is in line with this context This paper examines two Technological Foresight for traditional Bolivian activities: the "textiles from camelid fibers" sector and the "medicinal plants" sector. The study model takes into account two dimensions: the sociotechnical regime and the formal institutions. Findings highlights the difficulty to implement a virtuous circle of innovation because of innovation traps (1) that can be seen as a consequence of the socio-technical regime, and because of some misfit between formal institutions (2) and what is required by the value chain. These results emphasize the learning curve of the TF for countries such as Bolivia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cloud computing essentially is a scalable, flexible and pay-per-use model for the way IT services are delivered. It can significantly improve the way a government functions, the services it provides to its citizens and institutions. This paper aims to explore the factors that influence adopting cloud computing as a part of public sector organizations' alternatives to implement e-government services. Based on two dominant theories in the field of adoption of new technology, the Fit-Viability Model and Diffusion of Innovation Theory, a model is proposed. Data were gathered using a structured questionnaire with a sample of 296 IT staff employed in public organizations in Yemen. The results clarify the need to consider factors affecting two dimensions, fit and viability, to make a decision to adopt cloud computing in an e-government context. The fitness of cloud computing to e-government tasks is affected by factors such as relative advantage, compatibility, trialability and security, but is not affected by the complexity of the technology. On the other hand, the viability is influenced by economic factors (return on investment and asset specificity) and technological readiness (IT infrastructure and IT policy and regulations), while the results do not support the relation between the organizational factors such as top management support and cloud knowledge and viability.

AB Historical best practice emphasizes that the decision for large-scale R&D investment is important to catch-up growth. It is desirable in most developing countries to establish coherence between technological forecasting and science, technology, and innovation policies. This study demonstrates that national foresight has disadvantages in implementing such policies because of insufficient monetized information with discriminant power for investment. To compensate for such disadvantages, a logic model is indispensable, and can be achieved by subsequent foresight at the time of each decision rather than by one-time national foresight. The example of the Korean government emphasizes that decision-making involving consecutive value-based technological forecasting can act as an institutional framework to progress from catch-up development to being an advanced economy. Despite a tradition against aggressive R&D investment in Korea, quantitative ex-ante evaluations with a feasible value chain have given the financial authorities' confidence. This is what has made Korea's research boom possible. If developing or transition countries plan to achieve catch-up growth by expanding R&D investment, the institutional cases in this study will be an important reference. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Research SummaryThis study examines both the horizontal and the vertical dimensions of Chinese township industrial clusters in order to disentangle the determinants of catch-up performance. By examining 87 township clusters in Jiangsu Province, we find that a cluster's competitive intensity partially mediates the relationship between cluster size and cluster performance and that the number of R&D centers and interfirm joint actions in a cluster positively affects a cluster's innovativeness which, in turn, contributes to cluster performance. Our study not only helps shed light on what strategic factors led Chinese manufacturing clusters to catch up in the global value chain, but our findings can be used as a basis for comparison with other types of clusters around the world.
   Managerial summaryDespite the emergence of Chinese manufacturing industries over the past 30 years, little is known about how local clusters have helped Chinese firms catch up in global competition. By analyzing the performance of 87 township industrial clusters in Jiangsu Province, we find that the level of competition in a cluster mediates the relationship between cluster size and cluster performance and that a cluster's number of R&D centers and interfirm collaborations positively affect a cluster's innovativeness which, in turn, contributes to cluster performance. Our study contributes to a better understanding of cluster catch-up strategies, helping compare and contrast the differences between clusters from developing countries and ones from developed countries.

AB A growing body of literature recognizes the positive interplay between innovation and standardization. International organizations such as OECD and WTO also increase support for developing countries in building capabilities in innovation and standardization. Yet the relationship between innovation and standardization in developing countries, characterized by relatively weaker technological, economic and institutional capacities, remain under-researched. We review 63 articles extracted from the Web of Science database covering the innovation-standardization nexus in the context of developing countries. We discuss whether and how the relationship between innovation and standardization provides implications for the socioeconomic development in developing countries, and draw a conceptual model to understand the dynamics. Our result shows that standards facilitate innovation in three ways: innovation by scaling, proving and coordinating. While inducing and blocking mechanisms are at play, various stakeholders are involved in the relationship. Among them, the roles of the government and the technology/industry support organizations are highlighted, as they complement the relatively weak technological capabilities of other actors. In contrast to the existing literature on developed countries where standardization is depicted as a dynamic process to shape the innovation path, the current discussion on developing countries is skewed toward the adoption aspect of standards. We also suggest that there is a chasm between the goals of economic growth and those of social development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Regional innovation system; innovation cluster; government-led; "Pangyo
   Techno Valley'; Gyeonggi province
AB This paper investigates the effective formulation and implementation of Pangyo Techno Valley' (PTV), a regional innovation cluster led by Gyeonggi province in Korea. It emphasizes the historical, institutional and regional contexts to understand the concept of regional innovation cluster by using the framework of indicators of regional innovation. Especially this paper investigates PTV in terms of open innovation in supply chains. The development of PTV is theoretically interesting since the local government played an active role in providing with various incentives including physical space next to Seoul. This paper investigates the success factors for establishing PTV in the context of RIS and how a local government-led RIS can overcome the existing limits shown in other development policies the Korean government had pursued so far. This paper argues that the strategic investment and administrative support by Gyeonggi province and the location of PTV have played a critical role for the success of PTV by attracting abundant numbers of IT companies and competent talents. The finding is expected to provide an ample policy reference for other developing countries as they are eager to emulate the success of Silicon Valley' but have kept failing.

ID CULTURAL ECONOMY; INDUSTRIES; CITIES; EXPERTISE
AB This paper investigates how the creative economy discourse is interpreted and implemented in the context of Indonesia as a developing country. Our main conclusion is that the discourse is interpreted differently across localities. Bandung appears to be the only locality whose interpretation aligns with the general understanding of a creative economy that emphasises knowledge creation and innovation. This was made possible by the strong support from academia and communities who wanted to experiment with this policy idea. Our study also provides an insight into a creative economy developing not only as a discourse, but also as a workable framework for development policies, in this city. Conversely, other cities seem to pragmatically use the policy idea without considering the local context in a rebranding exercise in order to drive economic development, whereby traditional cultural industries are relabelled as creative despite performing hardly any innovation activities. Despite this, Bandung illustrates that there are possibilities for a developing country such as Indonesia to adopt the vision of a creative economy by reshaping local institutions to support successful experimentation with this new idea.

AB This paper contributes to a limited number of empirical studies focusing on African suppliers meeting international sourcing requirements in host countries. The present article is based on a survey of 110 companies targeting the emerging oil and gas industry and follows an explorative study design aiming to examine experiences, preferences and motivation of potential suppliers located in Tanzania. Techniques such as cluster analysis, graph visualization, descriptive statistics and concepts from social network analysis (SNA) were adopted to carry out the study. Our analyses show that only 15% of targeted firms collaborate, or have previously collaborated, with two or more companies and that close to one-third of the firms are unwilling to contribute financially for a training/development programme. Finally, a majority of the firms are willing to spend 15 days or less, which is assumed to be far below the minimum for an effective inter-firm improvement programme. Perhaps more interestingly, our study reveals that " open firms" are also more positive to contribute in improvement programmes. Several implications and guidance can be drawn from this study (e.g. need of a greater number of inter-firm collaborations, joint development initiatives including also foreign supplier firms, international oil companies and learning institutions).

AB Trees on farms are a widespread feature of landscapes across a large part of Ethiopia with an important role in enhancing the resilience of smallholder livelihoods through the provision of ecosystem services. Despite their importance, little is known about what trees are planted or retained from natural regeneration by different types of farmers that results in the pattern of tree cover found in the region. We address this knowledge gap through analysis of household survey data from semi-arid and sub humid areas of Oromia regional state. A set of composite variables that represent distinctive patterns of tree cover on farms were derived from principal component analysis and Pearson correlation analysis. This revealed two major tree adoption strategies: farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR) of trees to meet subsistence needs as well as contributing to other ecosystem services; and, high value agroforestry (HVAF) involving planted trees used largely to produce fruits, timber and fodder. Regression analysis further identified fine-scale variation in ecological and socio-economic factors that affect which of these two broad strategies are adopted by farmers. Favorable climatic conditions coupled with institutional arrangements to control free grazing were pre-conditions for HVAF, whereas poor biophysical potential and sloping land provided a positive incentive for farmers to adopt FMNR. Farmers with preferences for tree species with multiple utilities and locational flexibility favored FMNR while adoption of HVAF was more asset-driven. Our findings reveal that farmers integrate many native and exotic tree species on their farms to meet their variable farm conditions, needs and asset profiles in stark contrast to most tree promotion efforts that focus on a few, usually exotic, tree species. We recommend that future agroforestry promotion should embrace a diversity of tree species appropriate to matching the fine scale variation in ecological conditions and farmer circumstances encountered in the field.

AB Uganda is the largest producer of organic commodities in Africa. While most of the literature associate the start of organic agriculture in Uganda with the first certified project, no accounts exist about non-certified organic agriculture before 1993. Both in Europe and in the USA, pioneers drove non-certified organic agriculture as a response to economic, ecological and social crises. Uganda suffered two decades of civil war ending in 1986 causing multiple crises. We explore how post-war conditions influenced the emergence of organic agriculture in Uganda. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 12 organic agriculture experts from Central and Southwestern Uganda. Interviews were held in English using interview guides informed by a transition theoretical perspective. Interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using deductive and inductive coding. Our analysis shows that the degraded environment, food insecurity and economic instability after the war created a sense of urgency for the rehabilitation of livelihoods. Pioneers, including civil society activists, farmers, entrepreneurs and researchers, responded by promoting low-cost, resource-conserving technologies and agronomic practices to smallholder farmers. Economic liberalization, decentralization and institutional vacuum eased pioneers' activities, despite facing opponents from the government and research. Through experimental learning, demonstration farms and cooperation with the Catholic Church, public extension services, researchers and international development-oriented non-governmental organizations, pioneers reached out to farmers in Eastern, Central and Southwestern Uganda. As challenging as post-war crises may be, they offer opportunities for changing development trajectories. Therefore, reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts can accommodate sustainability concerns and allow the introduction of course-changing measures in any sector.

AB In recent decades, the role of farmers' associations in developing countries has been increasing due to a number of projects promoted by local and international governmental and non-governmental institutions and organizations. This paper analyses the effectiveness of collective action in enhancing farmers' market performances in terms of production quantity, production quality and profit. Specifically, the study points out the role of associations in leveraging smallholder market performance by providing learning, production and network support. In-depth interviews with local sesame value chain actors and a structural equation model based on a survey involving 97 farmers in East Chad are implemented. The farmers involved are part of the EU Project "Peanut and sesame food chain support: from production to marketing" led by a governmental organization. Results show that collective action supportive activities can effectively leverage farmers' market performances. Some policy implications for research and development organizations are finally discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the intense Research and Development input has not brought about the expectable output. While China is ascending at a great speed to a leading position worldwide in terms of Research and Development investment, scientific publications and patents, the innovation capabilities in the pharmaceutical sector remain weak.
   Discussion: This study discusses the challenges and opportunities for pharmaceutical innovation in China. One hand, academic, industrial, institutional and financial constraints were found to be the major and inevitable barriers hindering the development of drug innovation. On the other hand, unique advantages had been observed which included growing pharmaceutical market, Research and Development funding, distinctive source, and international cooperation.
   Summary: The most important thing for China's pharmaceutical sector to leap forward is to break though innovation barriers and integrate own advantages into global value- chain of healthcare product development.

AB Our argument revalidates and advances the idea of learning that is central to literatures on economic development, innovation and industrial policy. Global shifts where developing countries are advancing and innovating at the technological frontier challenge the conventional view of learning that focused on adapting existing technologies from advanced economies to build domestic firms' capabilities. Our research contributes to capture new dynamics of innovation, emerging technologies and government industrial policy, crucial in the learning perspective. Our field study of Brazilian government programmes in the bio-based industry illustrates how industrial policy is reinvented to catalyse firm innovation at the technological frontier.

DT Article
DE offshoring; agility; apparel industry; organisational innovation; time

ID INSIGHTS
AB Based on a case study from the apparel industry, the paper addresses how the organizational innovations adopted by Benetton and Inditex allowed them to balance lower production costs in developing countries with an adequate response time to frequent preference changes and increasing demands for customisation. Findings confirm the fragility of multinationals whose offshoring strategy has not considered the costs of coordinating suppliers in far-off locations and suggest organisational improvements that make production costs, variety and time to market goals compatible. Our research thus provides a view of the conditions and processes that can overcome in increasingly volatile environments the misalignment between demand changes and the limited reactivity of industrial infrastructures. Furthermore the innovation strategy of textile companies has created generalizable lessons for other sectors in which demand uncertainty is high, life cycles short, and customers are, to some extent, prepared to pay for "speed to market".

AB In this study we analyze the relationship between national cognitive abilities and innovational output using data from 124 countries of the world. By employing cross-country IQ scores traditionally used by psychological literature to represent national intelligence, and Economic Complexity Index as a novel measure of innovation, our study shows that there is a positive connection between them. We use a variety of tests to check the robustness of the nexus. Overall, our findings indicate that more intelligent nations export more sophisticated and diverse products to the world market and thus are more innovative. Therefore, developing countries should consider investing in human capital and related institutions if they are to boost innovative capabilities and move up the technology ladder in producing and exporting sophisticated and varied lines of products. This should bring them greater economic diversity which could be a right lever in mitigating negative external shocks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Motivation: Currently, an increasing role in achieving the competitive advantage is at- tributed to knowledge and its conversion to new products and services. For this reason, institutions have been set up, which are designed to stimulate the innovation activity in the economy. Their development was initiated in developed countries, and then moved to the developing countries.
   Aim: The article presented the influence of business support institution, which most frequently occur in the Polish reality, i.e., technological parks, technological incubators, academic business incubators, technology transfer centers, business angel networks, local or regional loan funds, credit guarantee funds and training-advisory centers for the innovation activity of industrial companies with consideration of the manufacturing techniques used by them in the developed regions of Poland, i.e., from the Lower Silesia, Silesia and Greater Poland.
   Results: Innovation attributes were distinguished according to the standards of studying the innovation activity contained in the Oslo methodology. For the conduct of analyses the probit modeling was used. The hypothesis of the article is the statement that the in- novation of companies will grow after establishing cooperation with business support institutions, while its level will be bigger when the level of manufacturing technique used by the companies is bigger.

AB To combat soil erosion in the northern part of Taraba State, Nigeria, farmers are of major importance. Their perceptions vitally influence the levels of support and investment associated with solving problems of soil erosion through adoption of practices that are alternative to those in current use, including approaches focused on soil conservation. The objective of this study was to evaluate how farmer perceptions of soil erosion influence their investments in soil conservation, particularly soil or stone bunds, their applications of organic amendments and inorganic fertilizers and other soil conservation practices. In the study area, we undertook a field plot experiment and carried out a survey, using open- and closed-ended questions. Water erosion and depletion of fertility were taken as the main indicators of soil erosion. The results of the experiment showed that farmers were aware of and perceived both indicators as having increased over the past decade. Farmer investments in water erosion control (3.7US$/ha) and the prevention of soil fertility depletion (37.8US$/ha) in the study area were found to be limited. The results also showed that awareness of water erosion was only marginally correlated with investment in water erosion control (chi(2)=4.906, P=0.09) and not associated with investments in soil fertility control measures (chi(2)=0.175, P=0.92). Those farmers who identified depletion of soil fertility as a problem, based on erosion, were not significantly more likely to make greater investments in soil conservation (chi(2)=0.947, P=0.62) but did invest more in fertility measures (chi(2)=3.199, P=0.20). Hence, further research is needed to determine other factors that may influence farmer investment in soil conservation, especially factors related to socio-economic characteristics of farm households, institutional and technological innovations and field characteristics that were not addressed in this study.

TI The additionality impact of a matching grant programme for small firms:
   experimental evidence from Yemen
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Matching grant; additionality; firm subsidy; fragile states; spurring
   innovation
AB Matching grants are one of the most common types of private sector development programmes used in developing countries. But government subsidies to private firms can be controversial. A key question is that of additionality: do these programmes get firms to undertake innovative activities that they would not otherwise do, or merely subsidise activities that would take place anyway? Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can provide the counterfactual needed to answer this question, but efforts to experiment with matching grant programmes have often failed. This article uses an RCT of a matching grant programme for firms in Yemen to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting experiments with well-designed programmes, and to measure the additionality impact. In the first year, the matching grant is found to have led to more product innovation, firms upgrading their accounting systems, marketing more, making more capital investments and being more likely to report their sales grew.

AB Information systems (IS) innovation in healthcare is a contested area often characterized by complex and conflicted relationships among different stakeholders. In this paper, we provide a systematic understanding of the mechanisms through which various actors translate competing visions about health sector reforms into policy and action and, thus, generate contradictions in IS innovation. We argue that we can learn more about the source of such contradictions by examining how competing frames can affect IS innovation in healthcare. We adopt frame theory and rhetorical strategies analysis in the case of health sector reforms in Kenya and focus specifically on the deployment of health information systems (HIS). We make several contributions. First, we demonstrate that policy actors' adherence to the interests and values represented in a frame is important in determining the choice of a rhetorical strategy and its influence on policy transformation and IS innovation. Second, we develop an understanding of how technology mediates the rhetorical strategies of different actors. In particular, we demonstrate the role of technology in giving continuity to frames, which affects policy change and IS innovation.

AB Most city agglomerations of developing countries face water shortages and pollution due to population growth and industrial aggregation. To meet such water security challenges, policy makers need to evaluate water use efficiency at the regional or basin level because the prosperity of city agglomerations is indispensable to the sustainable development of the region or basin. To solve the issue, this paper adopts a non-directional distance function within the framework of environmental production technology to measure water use efficiency. Based on the distance between actual water use efficiency and the ideal efficiency, it calculates the potential reduction space of water input and pollutants by slack adjustment. Added to the Malmquist index, it forms a non-radial Malmquist water use performance index, which can be divided into technological change and technical efficiency change, to measure dynamic water use efficiency. Further, water use efficiency change is analyzed from the perspectives of technological improvement and institutional construction. Bohai Bay city agglomeration, a typical water-deficient city agglomeration in China, is taken as a case study, and data on water resource, environment, and economy from 2011 to 2014 have been used. In conclusion, there is much space for water use efficiency improvement on the whole. However, even having considered potential reduction space of water input and pollutant discharge under current environmental production technology, it is still not enough to support the city agglomeration's sustainable development. To relieve current potential water safety hazards, not only technical improvement but also institution innovation for highly efficient water use should be kept accelerating in Bohai Bay region. In terms of urban water management in developing countries, the research conclusion is of theoretical and practical significance.

AB This study explores factors associated with success and intensity of livestock feed technologies use among positive deviants in feed technology adoption in Ethiopia. We used a nation-wide dataset of over 603 farm households, which surveyed pockets of successes in using improved livestock feed technologies. Heckman two-stage estimation procedures were used to identify factors associated with success and intensity of livestock feed technology use simultaneously. Results from the first stage of selection equation show that households socioeconomic and institutional factors such as education status of the head, herd size, exercise in feed technology utilization, cooperative membership, distance to district center, and diverse use of technologies have significant effect on success in livestock feed technologies adoption. The second stage demonstrates that intensity of household collaboration or network, membership in livestock related cooperatives, training, access to livestock feed technologies with packages, diverse use of technologies, engagement in livestock enterprises, livestock management system, willingness to invest more in feed technologies, and agro-ecologies significantly influence the intensity of feed technologies use. These results suggest that success and intensified use of improved feed technologies demand different entry strategies for risk factors, enablers, and behaviors, which may differ from the classic agricultural technologies transfer system. These include availability of appropriate biophysical and resource environments, functional linkages between different actors, access to inputs and social capital, and enabling institutional support system. Moreover, this study shows that when there is limited adoption, few pockets of success in improved technologies use, positive deviant approach would be more informative to understand the underlying factors and principles for success and intensified use of technologies than the most commonly reported conventional adoption rate studies.

AB The existing literature about informal development in China's cities is dominated by studies of conventional informal housing in urban villages, while a new type of informal housing, gated informal housing communities, has rarely been studied. The paper aims to contribute to the existing literature by discussing why and how these gated informal housing communities were developed, looking at the case of Beijing. The results of the analysis show that institutional discrimination against rural areas with respect to land use rights, revenue redistribution, policymaking procedures and the hukou-related social welfare system the major drivers of development of informal communities. In particular, informal development is influenced by the ways land value is captured by, compensated for and allocated to the state government rather than rural villagers in the process of its transfer from rural to urban land. For future policy, more institutional innovation or reform is imperative in order to adequately deal with the emergence of gated informal housing communities. Institutionally inclusive land and housing policies, rather than intense top-down control, are needed in China. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The project SPIRIT was conducted in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya from 2012 to 2016 with the aim of increasing the contribution of agricultural science, technology and innovation to social development in East Africa. The project involved literature research, on-site visits and meetings with farmers, research institutions and stakeholders, information compilation, database establishment and a project webpage. A strategy with three main objectives and associated actions was implemented. The first objective focused on the improvement of scientific and technological knowledge of East African research organizations. For this, state-of-the- art research on innovative technologies and practices for enhanced product quality was assessed; a web-based knowledge-sharing platform was created; the "East Africa Potato Research and Knowledge Exchange Forum" was constituted and six meetings with visits were realized. The second objective focused on private and civil society actors and governmental services and aimed at reinforcing their capacities for generating and adopting innovative technologies and practices. Sixteen innovation sessions were conducted. Guidelines for enhancing product quality along the potato value chain in East Africa were elaborated and disseminated. The third objective targeted governmental bodies with competences in policy-making for promoting changes in policies. Proposals for policymakers were developed and transferred to relevant authorities.

AB We investigated a number of factors that influence the transfer and commercialization of biotechnology for health care at Cinvestav, a leading Mexican research institute and major contributor to biomedical sciences in the country. Mixed methods were used, where we sent a survey to all the principal investigators (PIs) doing research in health-oriented biotechnology at Cinvestav that we could identify and asked them about their transfer of technologies activities, and interviews were carried out with those PIs who are currently pursuing projects for commercialization. Our results show that, despite a strong publishing record on the international front, most of these scientists lack a business-oriented focus. Further business expertise does not appear to be readily available or helpful at the institutional technology transfer office. Weak collaboration strategies reflected in a low number of key partnerships, together with a lack of private financing, also limit the capacity to transfer and commercialize the technologies being generated. The local scientific tradition and conditions do not seem to be amenable to these kinds of efforts, nor does the government pursue a coherent strategy to promote technology transfer and commercialization in health biotechnology. Consequently, promising projects take too long to develop and usually go to a limited extent through the consecutive patenting and licensing steps, both indicators of commercial activity in academia. The end result is a lack of success in making the results of new scientific knowledge beneficial for public health, a problem experienced not only by Mexico but shared by a number of low-and-middle income countries. We discuss the need for an urgent change in concerted vision by research institutions in developing countries, so as to engage their robust scientific infrastructure with the social and health demands of their populations.

AB The existing literature about informal development in China's cities is dominated by studies of conventional informal housing in urban villages, while a new type of informal housing, gated informal housing communities, has rarely been studied. The paper aims to contribute to the existing literature by discussing why and how these gated informal housing communities were developed, looking at the case of Beijing. The results of the analysis show that institutional discrimination against rural areas with respect to land use rights, revenue redistribution, policymaking procedures and the hukou-related social welfare system the major drivers of development of informal communities. In particular, informal development is influenced by the ways land value is captured by, compensated for and allocated to the state government rather than rural villagers in the process of its transfer from rural to urban land. For future policy, more institutional innovation or reform is imperative in order to adequately deal with the emergence of gated informal housing communities. Institutionally inclusive land and housing policies, rather than intense top-down control, are needed in China. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study examines how firm-level resources interact with regional institutional quality to explain innovation in East Africa. We hypothesize that the institutional environment within which the firm operates moderates the effect of firm-level resources on innovative output. We examine the moderating role of institutions with regards to the transformation of firm-level resources including internal research and development, human capital and managerial experience into innovative output using firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey and the Innovation Follow-up Survey for three countries in East Africa including Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. We test our hypotheses using a clustered robust standard errors logistic model. We find that the effects of firm-level resources vary depending on the institutional environment and that regional institutional quality positively moderates the effects of firm-level resources.

AB The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) enables transferring technology from developed countries to developing countries, such as Malaysia, and simultaneously promotes sustainable growth. Although this has been proven, the contribution of Malaysian companies in CDM projects is low. Therefore, this study has been aimed at investigating the determinants of CDM adoption and its impact on companies' performances. Data were gathered by surveying 91 companies in the energy, agriculture, and forestry sectors in Malaysia implementing CDM projects. The data were analysed using the partial least squares technique. The results show that environmental regulations, competitiveness, and financial benefits have a positive impact on CDM implementation. Additionally, this study reported a significant positive effect of CDM implementation on economic performance. This paper extends the knowledge on the determinants and financial outcome of CDM implementation. The information given in this research might be beneficial for policy makers and managers in modifying tactics and strategies towards successful promotion of the CDM in developing countries.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a new typology to leverage the different knowledge gaps existing between universities and industries. This new typology classifies interactions into training-oriented, diffusion-oriented, service-oriented, development-oriented, and research-oriented.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Brazilian 2010 Census data available from the CNPq Research Group Directory were used to test the typology.
   Findings - It was found that, among the five types of interactions proposed, the most frequent were the development-oriented (39 per cent), diffusion-oriented (23 per cent), and research-oriented (16 per cent) ones. These findings indicate that it is likely that university-industry (U-I) interactions have improved in terms of quality in an attempt to attain a joint higher technological development.
   Originality/value - The paper provides the U-I interaction debate with a new perspective about the kinds of interactions that could effectively bridge the knowledge gaps between universities and industries, especially in a developing country context.

AB This article presents conceptual and methodological developments made in analyzing the scale up of results-based financing (RBF) as part of a multicountry research program supported by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research. Following a brief overview of the research process, the article proposes a new five-dimensional conceptualization of scale-up (population coverage, service coverage, health system integration, cross-sectoral diffusion, and knowledge expansion) to capture various facets of RBF scale-up. It also presents how Walt and Gilson's health policy triangle framework was modified to identify the enablers and barriers to scale-up in the country case studies included in this research program. The article then puts forth a four-phase model of scale-up, including phases of generation, adoption, institutionalization, and expansion, developed for the purpose of this research program. The article concludes by providing some lessons learned on the use of the methods and theoretical frameworks developed for this multicountry research program.

AB Despite myriad studies having been carried out on the diffusion of geographical information systems (GIS) technology, only a limited number have been done within the context of developing countries. This paper addresses the research question, how did the diffusion of GIS technology occur in Uganda? Mixed methods were used for data collection, and analysis was performed using a theoretical framework called the diffusion of innovations (DOI). The results of the study showed that the adoption of GIS by institutions in Uganda occurred in a classic diffusion pattern consistent with diffusion theory. Adoption of GIS was promoted by its relative advantage over, and compatibility with, existing technologies. It was characterized by both heterophilous and homophilous communication channels, and influenced by change agents and champions. Its rate of adoption followed an S-shaped diffusion curve, and was hampered by bureaucracy, and patronage-based societal norms. This study makes a contribution to literature on GIS diffusion in developing countries.

AB This paper analyzes the economic impact of unions on productivity in the manufacturing sector across six Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, and Panama. Using an augmented Cobb-Douglas production function, the paper finds that unions have positive, but mostly small, effects on productivity, with the exception of Argentina, with a large negative effect, and Bolivia, with no effect. An analysis on profitability shows that, in most cases, the positive productivity effects barely offset higher union compensation, and that unions are negatively related to investment in capital and R & D. Different explanations for these effects are discussed.

AB Purpose - As the ongoing oil prices' crisis is emerging as a major cause of concern for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, the constituent governments are attempting at undertaking measures of economic diversification to attain long-term sustainability. The author posits that open government data (OGD) has a significant role to play in facilitating the economic turnaround of the GCC region, given that OGD promotes innovation and economic growth besides providing avenues for collaboration and participation among different stakeholders.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following a structured literature review, the paper scans literature on OGD followed by providing a typology of countries on the basis of their OGD-adherence ("laggard", "caged", "forerunner" and "champ"). This is followed by a discussion on the ongoing oil prices' crisis, and evidentiary support is lent by examples from the OGD portals of each of the six GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates) to provide indicators as to how a robust OGD implementation may support their economic diversification objectives.
   Findings - Although the present OGD framework of the GCC is relatively weak, it is asserted that OGD has immense potential in facilitating the economic diversification initiatives of the GCC countries. Therefore, the GCC needs to strategize upon institutionalization of their OGD initiatives for realizing their "vision" and goals of economic diversification to result in an economic turnaround effectively.
   Originality/value - Besides providing a typology of countries as OGD-adherents and categorizing GCC as "forerunner(s)" on the basis of the typology, the originality of the study lies in its attempt to answer the research question: " what is the role of the OGD in facilitating the economic diversification of the GCC?" Conceding that the research on OGD in the GCC context is few and far between, the present study is a significant contribution to the extant literature pertaining to the roll-out of OGD in developing countries.

TI Increasing European Support for Neglected Infectious Disease Research
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Neglected infectious diseases (NIDs) are a persistent cause of death and disability in low-income countries. Currently available drugs and vaccines are often ineffective, costly or associated with severe side-effects. Although the scale of research on NIDs does not reflect their disease burden, there are encouraging signs that NIDs have begun to attract more political and public attention, which have translated into greater awareness and increased investments in NID research by both public and private donors. Using publicly available data, we analysed funding for NID research in the European Union's (EU's) 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7), which ran from 2007 to 2013. During FP7, the EU provided 6169 million for 65 NID research projects, and thereby placed itself among the top global funders of NID research. Average annual FP7 investment in NID research exceeded 624 million, triple that committed by the EU before the launch of FP7. FP7 NID projects involved research teams from 331 different institutions in 72 countries on six continents, underlining the increasingly global nature of European research activities. NID research has remained a priority in the current EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, Horizon 2020, launched in 2014. This has most notably been reflected in the second programme of the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP), which provides unprecedented opportunities to advance the clinical development of new medical interventions against NIDs. Europe is thus better positioned than ever before to play a major role in the global fight against NIDs. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how higher education institutions (HEIs) in developing countries can migrate their physical administrative work environment to a virtual platform to improve information management.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs an interpretive case study approach and a combined lens of activity and agency theories to understand how a developing country HEI attempted to improve its information management by migrating from a physical to a virtual administrative work environment.
   Findings - The findings show how contradictions caused by role conflicts, administrative staff's fear of elimination and external consultants' limited understanding of administrative rules and procedures can hamper work environment virtualisation. Such challenges should be resolved in order to achieve a successful virtual work environment that supports timely and accurate information management.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is limited by its single case perspective in one developing country. However, future studies can compare the experiences of HEIs from developed and developing countries in order to account for contextual differences.
   Practical implications - The study provides practitioners with insight into how to address conflicts between employees (as potential users) and external consultants during virtual system development and implementation. In particular, role conflict, fear of eliminating some administrative staff and consultants' limited understanding of administrative work procedures should be resolved for successful work environment virtualisation.
   Originality/value - The study is the first attempt to offer rich insight into the challenges associated with administrative work environment virtualisation for improved information management in HEIs, through the principal-agent relationship.

AB This article examines how stakeholders involve themselves in the higher education (HE) sector in donor-dependent Cambodia and to what extent and with what result these stakeholders succeed to collaborate, or fail to do so. This study is based on qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 46 key research participants from relevant institutions representing the major stakeholders in the sector. The triple helix model, advocating a close government-university-industry collaboration, is employed as a guiding tool for data analysis. The study identifies four categories of stakeholders in the sector, namely government, development partners, HE institutions, and the industries. The stakeholders contribute to the sector in diverging ways and at different levels. Despite their involvement, collaboration among stakeholders has remained very limited, impeding the advancement of the sector. Thus, stakeholder collaboration, as postulated in the triple helix model, has yet to emerge in the Cambodian context.

DE Climate Change; Innovation; Health Economics; Health Policy

AB In recent years there has been an extensive scientific and public debate on climate change and its direct as well as indirect effects on human health. According to the World Health Organization, climate change impacts health directly, indirectly, and it affects social systems (the effects of undernutrition, induced migration, conflicts). The COP21 conference has highlighted numerous initiatives taken by companies, researchers, associations or public institutions to develop innovations that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and - promote adaptation to climate change. So-called 'green innovation' policies (associated with low-carbon technologies) are seen as an adequate response to the climate change threat. However, there is still a dearth of empirical work addressing the potential positive impact of low-carbon innovations on health effects attributable to climate change. Therefore, this article investigates the causal effect of low-carbon innovation on the health condition of the population in a sample of developing countries. It provides evidence on the beneficial, yet limited, impact of green innovations on the elimination of environmental risk factors affecting health.

AB Purpose - By applying the logic of the resource-based view and process-based internationalisation theory, this study aims to provide a better understanding of the effects of product innovation capability on the export scope of firms based in developing countries and the role of export experience as a facilitating mechanism.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using survey data obtained from three developing countries, two main research hypotheses were empirically tested: a quadratic relationship exists between product innovation capability and export scope and export experience has a moderating effect in this relationship.
   Findings - Product innovation capability and export scope have a U-shaped relationship, and export experience exerts a moderating effect. The greater the export experience is, the more the relationship between product innovation and export scope changes, taking on a more inverted U-shaped form.
   Practical implications - Firms based in developing countries need to catch-up on innovation capabilities before being able to succeed in international markets. Managers must be aware that initial investments in product innovation could not pay off immediately and that significant additional efforts might be needed to obtain noteworthy results in terms of international expansion.
   Originality/value - This study is among the first to focus on the curvilinear relationship between product innovation capability and export scope for firms based in developing countries while accounting for the moderating role of firms' export experience.

ID PRODUCT INNOVATION; CAPABILITIES; INDUSTRY
AB Purpose - The dynamics of the competitive performance of the small medium firms is an evolving field of research in the developing countries like India. The influence of the innovation on the competitive performance of the firms is still an evolving area in India. This paper aims to explore the influence of the innovation on the competitive performance. The study is based upon the agro-food processing industry of the Jammu and Kashmir state of India.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based upon the exploratory design. It uses quantitative as well as qualitative method for the firm level analysis of competitiveness. The aggregate index method has been used to construct the innovation competence and total competitive performance index. The regression analysis is used for describing the model based upon the primary data.
   Findings - The results of the study provide for a significant relationship between the innovation competence and firm level competitiveness. It describes the position of the agro-food processing firms under study with respect to the innovation competence index score and total competitiveness performance index.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper provides for the managerial implications of strategically incubating the innovation-based competence for the firms in specific geographical areas. The policy implications in terms of developing specific clusters and incubators for incremental and radical innovations can be derived, in regional economies.
   Originality/value - The paper discusses the issue of interaction of innovation competence and firm level competitiveness of the agro-food processing industry, which is dynamic, specifically in the developing states. The paper discussed unique methodology of using aggregate index method for defining the innovation competence and competitiveness for the firms where the consistency of data is a major issue for such a complex phenomenon.

AB This paper investigates how African governments are considering supporting and promoting the diffusion of solar PV. This issue is explored by examining so-called 'technology action plans (TAPs)', which were main outputs of the Technology Needs Assessment project implemented in 10 African countries from 2010 to 2013. The paper provides a review of three distinct but characteristic trajectories for PV market development in Kenya (private-led market for solar home systems), Morocco (utility-led fee-for service model) and Rwanda (donor-led market for institutional systems). The paper finds that governments' strategies to promoting solar PV are moving from isolated projects towards frameworks for market development and that there are high expectations to upgrading in the PV value chain through local assembly of panels and local production of other system elements. Commonly identified measures include support to: local production; financing schemes; tax exemptions; establishment and reinforcement of standards; technical training; and research and development.

DE Egypt; Motivations; Developing countries; Social entrepreneurship;
   Social entrepreneurs' characteristics
ID ENTERPRISES; MODEL; INNOVATION; ORGANIZATIONS; OPPORTUNITIES;

AB Purpose - This study aims to explore the characteristics and backgrounds of social entrepreneurs, particularly in relation to what motivates them to start new social ventures, through an empirical examination of the phenomenon of social entrepreneurship in the specific context of Egypt.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a qualitative methodological approach based on a triangulation of data sources, including extensive interviews from five social entrepreneurs, interviews with senior executives in their organisations and industry experts, as well as secondary data.
   Findings -The paper proposes a model that integrates common characteristics and motivations among individuals who start social ventures. Findings confirm the characteristics of social entrepreneurs as compassionate risk-takers with entrepreneurial mindsets who seek to address social issues in innovative ways. They also have the perseverance to face the inefficient institutional frameworks prevalent in developing economies. Social entrepreneurs are motivated by social problems and challenges, inspiration, and previous personal experiences, as well as their social networks.
   Research limitations/implications - There are limitations pertaining to the limited sample size and single country focus.
   Practical implications - This research offers useful and practical insights for current and future social entrepreneurs, particularly in developing economies. Moreover, the study contributes to expanding future research on social entrepreneurship in similar contexts.
   Originality/value - This study makes several contributions to the literature on social entrepreneurship. First, by presenting an integrated model for the characteristics/traits and motivations of social entrepreneur. Second, it provides deeper understanding of social entrepreneurship in emerging economies. Third, it highlights the importance of personal inspiration and informal social networks as two sources of motivation for social entrepreneurs, in emerging countries.

AB Given the importance and role of high-tech exports in economic growth, it is necessary to identify variables affecting export. Accordingly, in this article we studied the determinants of export for 24 developing countries during the period 1996 to 2013 based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Weighted-Average Least Square (WALS) technique. The results show that rule of law as a proxy for Institutional quality, human capital, import (as a measure of openness) and GDP with posterior inclusion probability 100% are the most important variables influencing the high-technology export in developing countries.

AB This paper investigates the roles of formal institutions and social capital in countries' innovation activities. The sample consists of 62 developed and developing countries, using the ordinary least squares robust standard error estimations, instrumental variable (IV) estimators, and quantile regression. The empirical results indicate that formal institutions and social capital complement one another in influencing countries' innovations level. In terms of the relative importance of both in promoting innovation activities, the social capital has greater role compared to formal institutions. Furthermore, the empirical result suggests that innovation level tends to be higher in countries with higher social capital. We also use the quantile regression to estimate whether the relationship among formal institutions, social capital, and innovation differs at different points in the conditional distribution of innovation. The results demonstrate that formal institutions yield a significant positive impact only after exceeding in 50th quantile, whereas social capital do so at lower 10th quantile. Therefore, in addition to a policy focus on improving the formal institutions, countries with a low level of innovation should enrich social capital in their promotion of innovation activity.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the promising potential of open data in Kazakhstan to boost public sector innovations and trace the emergence of the related civic engagement initiatives in order to understand how it affects the democratization of political communication processes in a typical developing country.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study research which begins with a brief history of the official open data project and then investigates various political and socioeconomic drivers, corresponding regulatory acts, the leading role of the key stakeholders and policy entrepreneurs in the diffusion of the open data movement as well as the main challenges associated with the advance of the open government concept in Kazakhstan, while various independent open data-driven projects provide a rich empirical basis for the analysis.
   Findings - Open data provides new opportunities to promote civic engagement and e-participation but does not affect the fundamentals of the political system nor advances democratic institutions in a typical developing country. The traditional directives could paradoxically be effective in advancing open data even in a less collaborative political culture. The unitary administrative context is conducive for the development of the ICT-driven public sector initiatives as a single platform. The existence of independent developers is crucial in promoting various open data-driven projects and sharing related expertise. The open data movement creates a favorable atmosphere for the participation of the non-governmental sector in the sphere.
   Research limitations/implications - This case study is primarily focused on the analysis of the open data movement at the national level of government, taking into account the unitary structure of the public administration system existing in Kazakhstan, which apparently has a crucial fundamental effect on the realization of any e-government system in this country. In this respect, the main limitation of the research is that the possible existence of various open data-driven projects at the local levels that hypothetically may have a different set of political and socioeconomic drivers and challenges was excluded from the final equation, which provides a new window for the future research in the area.
   Practical implications - The results of the research could be used by e-government practitioners and policymakers in evaluating and improving the operation of the open data-driven projects in many developing countries.
   Social implications - The author of the paper tried to develop a universal framework of the case study research that could be used in investigating the open data phenomenon not only in Kazakhstan but also in the context of other developing and transitional countries, especially in analyzing the apparitional emergence of the unique networking activities among the key stakeholders of the open data movement, i.e. policymakers, NGOs, businesses, developers, mass media and citizens. In addition, the results of the analysis could be used in testing the political and socioeconomic implications of the highly centralized e-government approach in the realization of the open data concept in a number of other typical unitary states.
   Originality/value - In scientific works, the open data phenomenon is usually analyzed in the context of the most developed and democratic countries of the world with a vast majority of case studies being focused only on North America and Europe, forgetting that it is a global trend. In contrast to the traditional trends in the academic literature, the author of the paper studies the realization of the concept in an unusual context, resorting to the case study of a typical emerging and post-totalitarian nation such as Kazakhstan and focusing on the analysis of the key drivers and challenges in the diffusion of the open data concept in an attempt to answer the ultimate question: whether it is really harnessed by the members of civil society to promote civic engagement and e-participation.

AB This study provides an overview of extension influence on the adoption of irrigation innovations in developed and developing countries, and finds that extension plays a more significant positive role in influencing soft technology adoption in developing countries. Case studies on the nature, use and availability of extension advice in six irrigation schemes in Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe are presented. The use of government extension officers varied significantly, with extension use not linked to farm outcomes. The results suggest the need to support more diverse sources of advice and to promote institutional reform in south-eastern Africa.

   Hausa farmers; Niger; West Africa; Human development
AB Most social innovation (SI) work done in developing countries is carried out through development agencies that focus on initiating innovations and processes, and establishing institutions that cultivate a change-oriented mindset. I offer a general critique of that approach and I link that critique with my observations from 15 years living and working among rural indigenous people in West Africa. I suggest that, not only do much of the SI processes fail to show respect for the creativity and intelligence of indigenous people, they tend to come packaged with exogenous participatory processes, encourage scaling-up, and ignore innovation that is already occurring. These arguments set the stage for an examination of a system of innovation that I discovered operating in a Hausa village in Niger. This system not only challenges the most important theory explaining the adoption and spread of ideas, the diffusion of innovations, it also demonstrates how indigenous people in one of the poorest countries on earth are innovating without intervention or support from development agencies. I complete the paper by suggesting that in some cases more sensible SI can be facilitated by discovering and supporting indigenous processes of innovation rather than by focusing on initiating change.

DE small farmers; ICTs; Caribbean; technology
AB Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been shown to be useful in agricultural knowledge systems to improve communication linkages among research, extension services, and farmers. The end result would be new information and technologies being made available to those who need it the most in larger numbers and in a timelier manner. While the role of ICTs in stimulating technological, organizational, institutional, and policy innovations in developing countries has been recognized, in many Caribbean States where ICTs are becoming readily available, the development and use of ICT in agricultural research and innovation systems remain underexploited, despite the fact that the agricultural sector in these developing nations accounts for a significant amount of the total employed labor force. This article traces key developments in ICT use in the agricultural sector in the Caribbean region, while highlighting the challenges as well as the potential of this technology. Several initiatives in the region are described and suggestions made for the development of innovative, appropriate, and efficient information and communication systems.

AB Industrial development has always been seen as the main engine for economic growth due to its large economic multiplier and technological opportunities. However, manufacturing sectors are directly and indirectly responsible for a large share of overall environmental pressures, raising concerns for the environmental sustainability of manufacturing-based development. In this paper, we evaluate the drivers and decoupling trends of environmental pressures arising (directly or indirectly) from manufacturing production and consumption for a large selection of developed and developing countries. As a first step, we decompose changes in emission intensity of manufacturing sectors into a series of components by means of a shift-share analysis to identify the main drivers of change. A second step will compare direct environmental pressures generated by manufacturing sectors (production perspective) with the amount of emissions generated (domestically and abroad) by the domestic consumption of manufacturing goods (consumption perspective). Finally, we evaluate the possible emergence of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) dynamics for production and consumption perspective emissions for the world as a whole and for different continents. Results highlight that first, high income countries are generally more environmental friendly than the average and tend to be specialised in high-tech and greener sectors. Second, emission reduction is driven mainly by unobserved factors such as institutional quality and policy commitment. Finally, while production perspective shows some evidence of EKC dynamics, this result does not hold when shifting to the consumption perspective. Besides, some world area is able to compensate the growth effect exploiting technology dynamics.

AB This paper outlines possibilities for a green industrial policy with particular emphasis on developing countries. The question of green industrial policy is investigated by examining experiences and barriers to phasing-in green technologies, focusing on solar PV and energy efficiency as areas for a green industrial policy. The paper outlines a green transition approach to sustain a shift to cleaner and more energy-efficient production processes through clever policy mixes involving elements of push and pull. Rent management and policy adaptation by competent authorities are also part of the model. The paper offers concrete guidance to the question of what governments in developing countries can usefully and realistically do to phase in green technologies given the priorities for development, imperfect institutions for policy-making and implementation, weakly developed innovation systems, and problems of lock-in.

AB Inclusive innovation refers to the improvement of living conditions and creation of employment opportunities for the poor through the development or co-creation of new products, services, processes and business models aimed at resource poor communities. Based on an empirical study of 15 university-led inclusive innovation projects in the Western Cape Province in South Africa, using an inductive approach we apply an analytical framework that serves two purposes (1) to describe our empirical findings and (2) to develop a broader research agenda that identifies a number of key research questions on the role of inclusive innovation projects in developing countries, and ways of addressing those questions in future studies. The empirical findings reveal a wide variety of university departments and individual staff members engaging with low-income user groups or entrepreneurs to (co-)create, launch or operate inclusive innovations. Our analysis shows that unravelling the various structural components and functions can provide interesting new insights into the workings of inclusive innovation systems. The findings of our study illustrate the complexity of the subject matter and the urgent need for a system of innovation components' approach to enhance our understanding of inclusive innovation projects and to develop appropriate methodologies for measuring their impacts.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of investment climate and firm-specific variables on the growth of micro and small enterprises (MSEs) in Kenya.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper utilized a cross-section survey data of 2,536 MSEs in Kenya. Using the sales growth as the dependent variable, the paper tests the hypotheses that investment climate variables -entrepreneur perception of fairness and affordability of the courts in dealing with commercial disputes, access to formal credit, connections to utilities, crime incidences; and firm-specific resources affect MSE growth.
   Findings - Positive entrepreneur perception of the fairness and affordability of the courts, access to formal credit, connections to utilities, lower incidences of crime, entrepreneur education and experience positively affect MSE growth.
   Research limitations/implications - Although the context of the study is Kenya, the study has relevance to other developing countries especially Sub-Saharan Africa due to institutional similarities. The paper, however, uses cross-sectional data, which unlike panel data, do not allow for establishing dynamic relationships. This could be a potential area for further research.
   Originality/value - The paper is among the first to establish effects of entrepreneur perception on MSE growth with regards the court system in dealing with business disputes in terms of fairness, timeliness, affordability and enforcement. The paper also extends limited extant research on MSE growth constraints with regards to incidences of insecurity, access to bank credit, connections to utilities and internal resources.

AB This article explores the evolution of the field of military innovation studies, critiquing its theoretical foundations and setting out a number of challenges that must be overcome if the field is to fulfil its potential and enhance its contribution to wider disciplinary debates as well as to the practitioner community. Tensions between the main theoretical approaches to military innovation are examined as are the challenges inherent in its increasingly multidisciplinary character. The issue of whether military innovation studies constitutes a field in its own right is addressed before recommendations are made to expand the field's research agenda, broaden its theoretical base and strengthen its multidisciplinary credibility.

AB Background: To date, several models have been developed to evaluate e-health readiness in healthcare organisations; however, no specific tool has been designed to assess or measure e-health readiness. Objective: The aim of this research was to design an e-health readiness assessment tool and to apply this tool to two Iranian hospitals to assess their readiness for the implementation of e-health. Method: The study, which was undertaken in 2012, consisted of three phases: (i) review of existing models of e-health; (ii) design of an e-health readiness assessment tool; and (iii) trial of the assessment tool in two Iranian hospitals. Phase 1 consisted of a literature review that informed the development of the tool. In phase 2, we developed an e-health readiness assessment tool with feedback using two questionnaires from 40 employees from two teaching hospitals in Iran. In phase 3, we applied the tool to the same two Iranian teaching hospitals. Participants who completed the questionnaires were from management, health information technology, medical and nursing backgrounds and were familiar with e-health. A purposive sampling method was used to invite them to take part in the study. Data from the questionnaires were analysed using factor analysis and descriptive statistics. Results: Five dimensions and twenty-one indices were selected to be included in the e-health readiness tool. The 5 dimensions and their relative importance were e-health readiness (16%), information and communication technology (ICT) functions (15%), environmental readiness (20%), human resources readiness (29%) and ICT readiness (20%). The total e-health readiness scores for hospital A and hospital B were 0.22 and 0.4, respectively (a score of 1 is the ideal). Conclusion: It is important to assess the e-health readiness of hospitals to save time and money and be able to better prepare for ICT implementations. The e-health readiness assessment tool provides a relatively simple method for assessing hospitals and provides essential information to assist healthcare facilities focus preparations and planning for e-health implementations.

TI Complexity of agricultural technology development processes:
   Implications for uptake of new hybrid banana varieties in Central Uganda
SO COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE banana breeding; innovation system; matooke hybrids; technology uptake;
   Uganda
AB Low uptake of improved technologies remains a challenge to enhancing agricultural productivity and food security in developing countries. This paper uses the agricultural innovations systems approach to analyse how the recently released hybrid banana varieties (HBVs) were developed, and how the interplay between processes and actors affect their uptake in central Uganda. The study used a qualitative research design employing a case study approach. Data were collected through 20 key informant interviews and 5 focus group discussions with purposively selected actors and farmer research groups respectively, and analysed using thematic-content analysis in NVivo. Results indicate that the process of developing HBVs is dominated by agricultural research institutions with limited involvement of other actors such as farmers, private sector and extension staff. Further, there is limited integration of social aspects including gender in the banana technology development process. The study, therefore, recommends use of inclusive participatory approaches in breeding of HBVs while paying attention to gender-specific preferences and the intrinsic quality attributes such as food colour, texture, flavour and taste since these are critical drivers for uptake of the new banana varieties.

AB Smallholder farmers operate within a risky and uncertain context. In addition to climate variability and climate change, social, environmental, institutional, and market-related dynamics affect their agricultural decisions and ability to cope and adapt. In this paper, we develop and apply a set of framing questions to investigate the factors shaping farmer decision-making and how these are situated in pathways of response. Drawing on a literature review of decision-making for risk management, five questions are posed to frame enquiry: what livelihood decisions are undertaken by households, who makes what decisions, when do households make decisions and why do they make them, and how do decision making processes evolve and response pathways arise. This approach conceptualises and explores household decision-making in a holistic manner, moving beyond previous studies that examine smallholder decisions through disciplinary boundaries (e.g. psychology, economics, risk management) or particular theoretical approaches (e.g. bounded rationality, theory of planned behaviour). The framing questions together with key insights from literature are used to design and interpret empirical evidence from Pratapgarh, a tribal-dominated rainfed district in southeast Rajasthan, India. The findings suggest that while resource ownership and access are the main drivers of decision-making, socio-cognitive factors such as perceived adaptive capacity and perceived efficacy to carry out adaptive actions are equally important factors mediating farmer responses. We also find that the holistic approach helps explain how personal motivations and individual perceptions of adaptive capacity interact with socioeconomic, climatic, and agro-ecological dynamics at local and regional scales to mediate risk perception and inform response behaviour. A typology of response pathways demonstrates how different households' trajectories are determined. Making a case for mixed methods to investigate farmer decision-making holistically, this paper provides an approach that reflects the complex and iterative nature of real farmer decision making and can be used by researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to better understand and describe decision making and to develop informed policies and interventions.

TI HEALTH CARE'S GRAND CHALLENGE: STIMULATING BASIC SCIENCE ON DISEASES
   THAT PRIMARILY AFFLICT THE POOR
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID INNOVATION; MARKET
AB Perhaps the most compelling Grand Challenge in health care is addressing diseases that primarily afflict the poor. Policies and practices conceived in high-income countries for improving the lives of patients in low-income countries have been criticized as ineffective or harmful. We examine the impact of one such policy, the World Trade Organization's 1994 Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which was partly justified by a claim that patents and other intellectual property protections would improve the availability of drugs for "neglected diseases" such as malaria and tuberculosis. There is little evidence associating TRIPS with clinical trials, patents, or trade-in drugs for these diseases. One explanation for this is that basic science is required as a prerequisite to drug development. We theorize, test for, and find evidence that TRIPS encouraged the time-consuming and complex development of managerial institutions required for basic science on neglected diseases. The results indicate an increase in basic science on neglected diseases and in applied science on nonneglected diseases as countries became TRIPS compliant. In newly TRIPS-compliant, low-income countries, scientists intensified basic research on locally relevant diseases. We call for the application of management theories to grand challenges, and to the evaluation of policies such as TRIPS.

AB Despite decades of agricultural extension programmes, participatory research projects and efforts to encourage knowledge integration and sharing, few smallholder farmers are adopting natural resource management (NRM) practices. Using an agroforestry (AF)-based conservation practice known as conservation agriculture with trees as a case study, this study aims at contributing to the growing debate that a properly designed training programme enhances adoption of knowledge intensive NRM practices by providing resource poor farmers with the opportunity to learn, test and adapt such practices to suit their resource needs. To control for endogeneity in participation in training and assess the effect of training on adoption, we estimate an instrumental variable probit model using cross sectional data collected in 2013 from 198 farm households in Machakos district in Kenya. One key message emanating from the study, which is critical for development practitioners who are keen on up-scaling AF based conservation practices through training, is that strengthening technical capacity of smallholder farmers is necessary but it is not in itself sufficient to stimulate adoption of conservation practices. Instead, institutional factors like good road infrastructure that help reduce transaction costs associated with the search for information on technologies and markets and resource endowments in form of labour and land provide synergistic effects. Consequently, complementary strategies such as the introduction of cost effective labour saving technologies and the provision of enabling environment through public-private partnerships for farmers to access the technologies and inputs that are critical for implementing the skills acquired during the training are prerequisites for adoption.

AB Despite the increasing attention paid to the dispersion of research and development (R&D) activities, scholars have presented opposing arguments with respect to its effects on innovation output to date. To address this controversy, we conceptualize and empirically test a model that links different dimensions of R&D activities dispersion and innovation output. Moreover, few studies have explicitly addressed R&D activities dispersion among firms in emerging markets. Using a sample of 244 Chinese high-tech firms collected from 2000 to 2009, this study aims to determine how firms in developing countries domestically and globally distribute their activities. The results show that a firm in an emerging market with a decentralized R&D organizational structure with geographically centralized R&D activities has better innovation outputs. Moreover, institutional development positively moderates the relationship between the dispersion of R&D activities and innovation performance.

AB Background: Donors commonly fund innovative interventions to improve health in the hope that governments of low and middle-income countries will scale-up those that are shown to be effective. Yet innovations can be slow to be adopted by country governments and implemented at scale. Our study explores this problem by identifying key contextual factors influencing scale-up of maternal and newborn health innovations in three low-income settings: Ethiopia, the six states of northeast Nigeria and Uttar Pradesh state in India.
   Methods: We conducted 150 semi-structured interviews in 2012/13 with stakeholders from government, development partner agencies, externally funded implementers including civil society organisations, academic institutions and professional associations to understand scale-up of innovations to improve the health of mothers and newborns these study settings. We analysed interview data with the aid of a common analytic framework to enable cross-country comparison, with Nvivo to code themes.
   Results: We found that multiple contextual factors enabled and undermined attempts to catalyse scale-up of donor-funded maternal and newborn health innovations. Factors influencing government decisions to accept innovations at scale included: how health policy decisions are made; prioritising and funding maternal and newborn health; and development partner harmonisation. Factors influencing the implementation of innovations at scale included: health systems capacity in the three settings; and security in northeast Nigeria. Contextual factors influencing beneficiary communities' uptake of innovations at scale included: sociocultural contexts; and access to healthcare.
   Conclusions: We conclude that context is critical: externally funded implementers need to assess and adapt for contexts if they are to successfully position an innovation for scale-up.

AB The lack of technology adoption has been mentioned as a source of lack of inclusive participation of low income groups in economic activities leading to income disparity in developing countries. The study utilized an input-process-output framework to develop a set of indicators to inform the development of policies and practices to ensure the participation of low income groups in economic activities. The input element consists of technology adoption influencing factors such as socio-economic characteristics and innovating units and institutions that provide support for innovation activities. The process and output elements consist of the level of technology adoption in production processes and productivity measures respectively. Focusing on small-scale oil palm fruit processors in Nigeria, the study revealed that inadequate funding of the input processes lead to inadequate technology adoption in specific unit operations of palm oil production. Utilising selected physicochemical properties of palm oil as indicators of productivity, the samples of palm oil assessed were found to be unsuitable for industrial use and may limit the processors from participating in formal sectors of palm oil production. The study recommends policy levers that will enhance input factors through adequate funding to improve the technological base of the small-scale oil palm fruit processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Research and development (R&D) is one of the key factors contributing to the economic growths in both advanced and developing countries. Implementing technological innovation strategies to accelerate the research and development has thus become one of the most important industrial policies for governments. The R&D performance is highly influenced by the complexities of interactions among actors in an innovation system. An evaluation model that incorporates the influence of linking activities is highly desired. This study employed the actor-network theory to construct a three-stage R&D production framework that emphasizes the linking activities among basic research stage, technology translation stage, and system development stage. In addition, the network data envelopment analysis (DEA) method was used to evaluate the relative R&D efficiency across the global twenty-five countries. The analysis results screened out specialized efficient country at each sub-process and further constructed the efficiency group for benchmark-learning. This study also pointed to the importance of the research institution for technology commercialization. The potential application of network DEA and actor network theory approach in assessing the efficiency of R&D activities were also highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study applies a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to data from the Global Innovation Index (GII). Building on the National Innovation System's approach, this study posits that a country can achieve high innovation performance via several combinations of causal conditions. These conditions are the five input enablers of GII: institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, and business sophistication. By defining two subsamples of countries (high-income and low-income), this study finds that several causal combinations of conditions lead to high innovation performance in both groups. In order to obtain better innovation performance, the low-income countries show more multifaceted solutions. These results indicate that none of the conditions is necessary for predicting high innovation performance in both samples. Additionally, in the low-income group, none of the conditions, individually, is sufficient to predict higher innovation performance, while in the high-income group the infrastructure and human capital and research conditions, on their own, are sufficient to obtain better innovation performance. These results indicate that the political decision making processes required for improving the level of innovation need to be different for each group of countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Rural populations experience several barriers to accessing clinical facilities for malaria diagnosis. Increasing penetration of ICT and mobile-phones and subsequent m-Health applications can contribute overcoming such obstacles.
   Methods: GIS is used to evaluate the feasibility of m-Health technologies as part of anti-malaria strategies. This study investigates where in Uganda: (1) malaria affects the largest number of people; (2) the application of m-Health protocol based on the mobile network has the highest potential impact.
   Results: About 75% of the population affected by Plasmodium falciparum malaria have scarce access to healthcare facilities. The introduction of m-Health technologies should be based on the 2G protocol, as 3G mobile network coverage is still limited. The western border and the central-Southeast are the regions where m-Health could reach the largest percentage of the remote population. Six districts (Arua, Apac, Lira, Kamuli, Iganga, and Mubende) could have the largest benefit because they account for about 28% of the remote population affected by falciparum malaria with access to the 2G mobile network.
   Conclusions: The application of m-Health technologies could improve access to medical services for distant populations. Affordable remote malaria diagnosis could help to decongest health facilities, reducing costs and contagion. The combination of m-Health and GIS could provide real-time and geo-localized data transmission, improving antimalarial strategies in Uganda. Scalability to other countries and diseases looks promising.

AB This study combines legal and anthropological approaches to investigate how the establishment of a large-scale biofuel agro-industry is reinterpreting and potentially transforming customary institutional arrangements in rural Sierra Leone. The contractual relationships established between land acquirers and local authorities can be seen as an institutional innovation' that aims at interpreting and overcoming the limits of the national land regime. However, by formalizing customary land tenure structures through land registration, such innovations are exacerbating pre-existing social inequalities. We identified four categories of resulting conflicts: interlineage, intervillage, interfamily and intergenerational conflicts. Taken together, these conflicts question the current land-based sociopolitical structures of rural Sierra Leone and could be drivers of societal change.

AB The knowledge-based view suggests that the innovative performance of a firm is a function of the utilization and recombination of internal and external knowledge. The process of knowledge utilization and recombination to create new products can occur internally, through research and development activities, as well as externally, by making investments in creating links with suppliers, universities, customers, and a wide range of actors in the innovation system. This study focuses on the impact of unique, nonmimetic external knowledge, which is defined as unique technological knowledge that is not tapped by other firms in the new venture's operating environment, on the new venture's innovative performance. The purpose of the research is to investigate whether firms really benefit from utilizing and recombining unique, nonmimetic knowledge in creating innovative products in a developing country context. Drawing on the knowledge-based view and institutional theory, this study argues that entrepreneurs in their utilization and recombination of unique, nonmimetic knowledge are not always successful at creating new products. The empirical context is drawn from the Enterprise Survey produced by the Investment Climate Group of the World Bank. The findings based on a large sample of new ventures in developing countries reveal a curvilinear relationship with marginal diminishing returns between the degree of unique, nonmimetic knowledge and innovative performance. The results also show significant moderating effects of strategic product planning and economic and regulatory policy uncertainty. Specifically, strategic product planning helps in converting very unique, nonmimetic knowledge into new products. In addition, policy uncertainty can also positively moderate the process of recombining and converting unique, nonmimetic knowledge into new products. This study provides a more complete account of how unique, nonmimetic external knowledge affects innovative performance of new ventures in developing countries.

AB Although the pharmaceutical industry does not usually feature prominently in overviews of research on development, the sector has considerable significance for both health and economic development. This article reviews research on the pharmaceutical industry in the global South, identifying some broader themes that echo with prominent debates in the wider realm of development studies. In research in the 1970s and early 1980s, the pharmaceutical industry seemed to represent a near-classic illustration of the power and influence of large, Northern-based multinational companies, producing dependent development. Later research focused on patent issues in relation to the debate over the TRIPs Agreement, with policy developments in the sector being used to highlight institutional monocropping within global governance. More recently again, research on access to medicines, patent policymaking and local pharmaceutical production has highlighted complementarities between industry and health. Increasingly bridging an oft-present dichotomy, which is also manifest within geographical research, between economic and social aspects of development, recent research on pharmaceuticals challenges some conventional aspects of development theory.

TI Positioning smallholder farmers in the dairy innovation system in
   Malawi: A perspective of actors and their roles
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE Actor; dairy system; innovation; institutional transformation; network
AB The preference of an innovation systems approach to development is based on its inclusiveness and the interactions of actors to co-influence each other, to learn and innovate and to bring about tangible benefits. As more actors with diverse interests engage, the innovation system becomes more complex and actors with higher influence power are likely to benefit more. Smallholder farmers in developing countries are the core actors of an agricultural innovation system, but their ability to influence other actors to maximize their benefits is questionable. This article applies a historical analysis of the progressive development and complexity of Malawi's diary innovation system through phased emphasis on technological, organizational and institutional development to illustrate the centrality of smallholder dairy farmers in the innovation system. A social network analysis is applied to assess the influence of smallholder farmers on other actors. The existence and growth of the diary innovation system in Malawi is founded on the resilience of smallholder dairy farmers to produce milk. Whereas the smallholder farmers are the most connected in terms of interaction, they have the least influence on other actors in the innovation system. To take advantage of their central position to maximize benefits, smallholder farmers can only rely on their collective power to influence others. Organizing farmers in groups and associations is a step in the right direction but deliberate interventions by innovation brokers as intermediaries need to focus on empowering these groups.

AB When Technology Foresight (TF) began to be adopted in industrial countries, it tended to be still somewhat a marginal activity in developing countries. Today globalization radically transformed the range of economic activities that developing countries can perform. Production is fragmented and organized along global value chains. Dense flows of knowledge and technology are available, but need to be fully employed in the framework of coherent industrial strategies.
   This paper examines how and to which extent TF programs are needed in developing countries given the new prevailing global context. It argues that the TF and industrial strategy are and must be mutually consistent and they need to be taken seriously, coherently designed and implemented in light of their role to shape and economic growth. We provide preliminary support to this argument by discussing the theoretical foundations and justification of TF and industrial strategy, and then reviewing some relevant examples from Brazil, Chile and South Korea.

AB Since 2015, the government of Cameroon has challenged stakeholders nationwide to move toward a network economy also known as the digital economy; aiming to foster the development of the country. This ambition of the government has been a source of many discourses with not always the same vision on what is supposed to be done in the implementation of this new economy. Different structures are mainly involved in this project following government organization, which recognizes certain attributions to each public or private institution. But they lack a clear vision of what are the prerequisites for such endeavor. Hence, without a clear roadmap, time and resources would be wasted, while other countries with clear roadmap and vision would make a difference and leapfrog in growth and development. This reality seen in many African developing countries in their conceptualization of digital economy has pushed us to ask the following questions: What is the digital economy? In what conditions can a developing country claim readiness for the digital economy? The purpose of this paper is to attempt to answer these questions in the context of the digital transformation of Cameroon. The study examines the readiness of Cameroon to develop its digital economy, by exploring some key factors such as the civil society, services and goods, the policies, regulations and underlying technological infrastructures that are known as salient metrics related to the development of this economy. Practically, the study investigates qualitatively how Cameroon integrates these metrics in her ongoing projects and initiatives taken since 2010-1015, to become emergent and digital by 2035. The study presents challenges and perspectives of the Cameroonian case and provides in the framework of a roadmap, necessary measures and actions that should be considered in order to guarantee a successful development of digital economy in the country and in similar economies. The contribution of this paper is the definition of a roadmap for the implementation of digital economy in Cameroon. This roadmap can then be used as a guideline in the implementation of the digital economy in developing countries, with mere consideration of their socio-cultural context as there is no universal strategy for a digital transformation. The proposed guideline is based on policymakers as in these countries most innovations are government based.

   urbanization; nodality; urban-rural relations
AB In this paper, emphasis is placed on the complexity of rural-urban relations and their reflection on the important socio-geographical processes, from de-agrarian and migration to the creation of new settlements and strengthening nodality individual centres. A clear polarization in urban and rural areas is more difficult due to the lack of adequate statistical indicators or deployment of institutions with different degree of importance, population density and distance from major city, providing sufficiently clear evidence of the degree of urbanity of local communities. This can be best seen in the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) which is sparsely populated country with an average of 74 inhabitants/km2. Since there is a clear correlation between this indicator and sustainable development, increasing urbanization rates, which can stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty, is set as the primary social objective. Many developing countries looking for a way better governance of rural-urban relations, as one of the elements of inclusive growth, as a crucial element in the development of any society through innovation (industry) and harmonious territorial relations (urban-rural). Since BiH has a negative historical heritage but also unfavourable indicators of the degree of urbanization (40%), macroeconomic stability (29% of the GDP of the EU average) and the degree of innovation (44% compared to Switzerland) it is clear that should be analyzed and rural-urban relations as one of the signposts along the way of creating a better and healthier society.

AB Radiology in low-and middle-income (developing) countries continues to make progress. Research and international outreach projects presented at the 2015 annual RAD-AID conference emphasize important global themes, including (1) recent slowing of emerging market growth that threatens to constrain the advance of radiology, (2) increasing global noncommunicable diseases (such as cancer and cardiovascular disease) needing radiology for detection and management, (3) strategic prioritization for pediatric radiology in global public health initiatives, (4) continuous expansion of global health curricula at radiology residencies and the RAD-AID Chapter Network's participating institutions, and (5) technologic innovation for recently accelerated implementation of PACS in low-resource countries.

AB Technology transfers are important channels for firms in developing countries to get access to new technology and initiate innovation. This article examines the geographical pattern of technology transfers in the form of buyer-provided training in domestic and international production networks. Our unique buyer-supplier network data in four countries in Southeast Asia allow us to directly observe the buyer-supplier relationship as well as the existence of inter-firm provision of training for product/process innovation in order to investigate the geographical structure of knowledge acquisition, dissemination, and aggregation among local and non-local firms. The empirical analysis finds the following: (1) the probability of having training provided by the main buyer presents a U-shaped quadratic pattern with respect to the geographical distance between the respondent firms and the main buyers. The geographical proximity to the main buyer seems to be particularly important for local firms. (2) The training provision is likely for both local and non-local firms when the main buyer is a multinational located in the same country. (3) The probability of having training from the main buyer is high when the main buyer conducts R&D. (4) Both local and non-local firms that have training provided by their main buyers are likely to provide training to their main suppliers. (5) In the case of non-local firms, product innovation with production partners is more likely when they have upstream/downstream training. However, such links seem to be weaker in the case of local firms.

AB Entrepreneurship is regarded as key to economic growth, job creation, and greater prosperity. Indeed, entrepreneurship drives net job growth in the United States, the European Union, and some Asian countries. Yet the United States has experienced a decline in entrepreneurial dynamism since the 1970s, and some European countries continue to struggle to build a culture of entrepreneurship despite significant policy efforts. At the same time many developing countries are experiencing a net rise in entrepreneurial activity, leading many to wonder about a specific aspect of the institutional environment, what the economics and public policy literatures call economic freedom (EF): a summary measure capturing the freedom to engage in economic activity without undue restrictions or subsidies. The papers in this symposium focus on EF, each offering a specific perspective on how scholars can theorize and study the effects of institutions and institutional change on entrepreneurship, and the effects of entrepreneurship on institutions, at and across different levels of analysis.

AB Local management councils and multi-stakeholder forums are institutional arrangements used for policy dialogue, priority-setting and program monitoring but are rarely evaluated. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of 55 local-level Agricultural and Rural Management Councils (CARGs) in 23 randomly-selected territories in the western Democratic Republic of the Congo. These CARGs are similar to the farmers' forums in Uganda and research-extension linkages committees in Ghana and Nigeria in terms of their multi-level structures that aggregate inputs from villages up to the provincial and national levels, and are similar to Uganda's barazas at the sub-county level on participatory monitoring of programs and public service delivery. CARGs also play a major role in sharing innovations and providing advice to farmers by brokering knowledge and linking various experts and stakeholders, such as forming innovation platforms in various countries. However, CARGs are wider in the breadth of activities and are more generic in the thematic scope and coverage than other platforms. This paper identifies several problems and challenges in CARG implementation and the overall weaknesses in CARG formation. Our review suggests that only half of the surveyed CARGs achieved results consistent with at least one of their main goals, while the rest have not achieved any tangible outputs consistent with their objectives. Although the majority of stakeholders interviewed were aware of CARGs, only 33 % attended CARG meetings and perceived CARGs to be useful; and only 11 % reported having benefitted or knowing someone who had benefitted from CARGs. However, CARGs differ in performance and exhibit different financial capacity, coordination capacity, coordination commitment of its leaders, and representation of government officials, which are all significantly correlated to how well CARGs fulfill their objectives, link to other actors, and are perceived by stakeholders.

TI Coping with Migration-Induced Urban Growth: Addressing the Blind Spot of
   UN Habitat
SO SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Article
DE migration; urbanization; entrepreneurship; innovation; urban expansion;
   Jane Jacobs
ID CITIES; SLUMS; AID
AB The demography of cities in the 21st century will be shaped, to a large extent, by migration. This paper argues that the rights-based approach to urban policy advocated in the preparatory work of Habitat III, the UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development to be held in October 2016 in Quito, Ecuador, may not be conducive to this goal. The approach lacks a contextual and dynamic understanding of urbanization. It implicitly assumes that a growing and expansive urban economy would primarily benefit the rich and harm the poor. The resulting containment policies to stop "urban sprawl" and defend "the right to the city" can, however, be counterproductive if adopted in cities in less developed countries (LDCs) that grow fast due to internal migration. Attempts to limit urban growth may merely lead to more informal settlements, less affordable housing, and increasing costs of doing business. In other words, it may benefit the rich and harm the poor. LDCs should, therefore, refrain from adopting defensive urban policies mostly advocated by more developed countries (MDCs) and, instead, plan for sustainable urban expansion designed to improve access to essential urban services and to create a level playing field for newcomers in business. In this context, urban policies may build upon the basic insights of the late urbanist Jane Jacobs. She recognized that the vital function of cities is to provide affordable infrastructure and an institutional environment that enable migrants and other marginal urban communities to contribute to urban prosperity and problem-solving with their skills, networks, and entrepreneurial minds. The resulting social and economic empowerment increases access to essential human rights and ensures that cities become more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable.

AB It has now become almost a stylized fact that sustained agricultural growth is central to rapid poverty reduction and economic development. Yet, world poverty is largely concentrated in the agrarian societies, which have the potential for agricultural productivity growth. This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan African countries, where the gaps between potential and actual yields remain high. Minimizing this gap through the promotion of modern inputs such as fertilizer and modern seeds has been at the core of almost all development strategies in Ethiopia. Among other initiatives, the country has promoted microfinance institutions and member-owned financial cooperatives to alleviate credit constraints of the smallholder farmers. This paper analyzes the impacts of these institutions. Using household survey data and a propensity-score-matching technique, we examine the effects that institutional financial services have on farmers' adoption of agricultural technology in Ethiopia. The results suggest that access to institutional finance has a significant positive impact on both the adoption and extent of technology use. However, when impacts are disaggregated by type of financial institution and farm size, heterogeneities are observed. In particular, financial cooperatives have a greater impact on technology adoption than microfinance institutions, and the results appear to vary depending on farm size and types of inputs. The paper concludes with implications for policies to promote adoption of modern agricultural inputs. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Policy processes that yield good outcomes are inherently complex, requiring interactions of stakeholders in problem identification, generation of political will and selection of practical solutions. To make policy processes rational, policy dialogues are increasingly being used as a policy-making tool. Despite their increasing use for policy-making in Africa, evidence is limited on how they have evolved and are being used on the continent or in low and middle income countries elsewhere.
   Methods: This was an exploratory study using qualitative methods. It utilised data related to policy dialogues for three specific policies and strategies to understand the interplay between policy dialogue and policy-making in Cabo Verde, Chad and Mali. The specific methods used to gather data were key informant interviews and document review. Data were analysed inductively and deductively using thematic content analysis.
   Results: Participation in the policy dialogues was inclusive, and in some instances bottom-up participatory approaches were used. The respondents felt that the execution of the policy dialogues had been seamless, and the few divergent views expressed often were resolved in a unanimous manner. The policies and strategies developed were seen by all stakeholders as relating to priority issues. Other specific process factors that contributed to the success of the dialogues included the use of innovative approaches, good facilitation, availability of resources for the dialogues, good communication, and consideration of the different opinions. Among the barriers were contextual issues, delays in decision-making and conflicting coordination roles and mandates.
   Conclusions: Policy dialogues have proved to be an effective tool in health sector management and could be a crucial component of the governance dynamics of the sector. The policy dialogue process needs to be institutionalised for continuity and maintenance of institutional intelligence. Other essential influencing factors include building capacity for coordination and facilitation of policy dialogues, provision of sustainable financing for execution of the dialogues, use of inclusive and bottom-up approaches, and timely provision of reliable evidence. Ensuring continued participation of all the actors necessitates innovation to allow dialogue outside the formal frameworks and spaces that should feed into the formal dialogue processes.

AB Background: The Global Forum 2015 panel session dialogue entitled "From evidence to policy - thinking outside the box" was held on 26 August 2015 in the Philippines to debate why evidence was not fully translated into policy and practice and what could be done to increase its uptake. This paper reports the reasons and possible actions for increasing the uptake of evidence, and highlights the actions partners could take to increase the use of evidence in the African Region.
   Discussion: The Global Forum 2015 debate attributed African Region's low uptake of evidence to the big gap in incentives and interests between research for health researchers and public health policy-makers; limited appreciation on the side of researchers that public health decisions are based on multiple and complex considerations; perception among users that research evidence is not relevant to local contexts; absence of knowledge translation platforms; sub-optimal collaboration and engagement between industry and research institutions; lack of involvement of civil society organizations; lack of engagement of communities in the research process; failure to engage the media; limited awareness and debate in national and local parliaments on the importance of investing in research and innovation; and dearth of research and innovation parks in the African Region.
   Conclusion: The actions needed in the Region to increase the uptake of evidence in policy and practice include strengthening NHRS governance; bridging the motivation gap between researchers and health policy-makers; restoring trust between researchers and decision-makers; ensuring close and continuous intellectual intercourse among researchers, ministry of health policy-makers and technocrats during the life course of research projects or programmes; proactive collaboration between academia and industry; regular briefings of civil society, media, relevant parliamentary committees and development partners; development of vibrant knowledge translation platforms; development of action plans for implementing research recommendations, preferably in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals; and encouragement of competition on NHRS strengthening and research output and uptake among the countries using a barometer or scorecard to review their performance at various regional ministerial forums and taking into account the lessons learned from the MDG period.

TI That's not how the learning works - the paradox of Reverse Innovation: a
   qualitative study

AB Background: There are significant differences in the meaning and use of the term 'Reverse Innovation' between industry circles, where the term originated, and health policy circles where the term has gained traction. It is often conflated with other popularized terms such as Frugal Innovation, Co-development and Trickle-up Innovation. Compared to its use in the industrial sector, this conceptualization of Reverse Innovation describes a more complex, fragmented process, and one with no particular institution in charge. It follows that the way in which the term 'Reverse Innovation', specifically, is understood and used in the healthcare space is worthy of examination.
   Methods: Between September and Decemsber 2014, we conducted eleven in-depth face-to-face or telephone interview with key informants from innovation, health and social policy circles, experts in international comparative policy research and leaders in the Reverse Innovation space in the United States. Interviews were open-ended with guiding probes into the barriers and enablers to Reverse Innovation in the US context, specifically also informants' experience and understanding of the term Reverse Innovation. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically using the process of constant comparison.
   Results: We describe three main themes derived from the interviews. First, 'Reverse Innovation,' the term, has marketing currency to convince policy-makers that may be wary of learning from or adopting innovations from unexpected sources, in this case Low-Income Countries. Second, the term can have the opposite effect - by connoting frugality, or innovation arising from necessity as opposed to good leadership, the proposed innovation may be associated with poor quality, undermining potential translation into other contexts. Finally, the term 'Reverse Innovation' is a paradox - it breaks down preconceptions of the directionality of knowledge and learning, whilst simultaneously reinforcing it.
   Conclusions: We conclude that this term means different things to different people and should be used strategically, and with some caution, depending on the audience.

TI Institutional change to compensate for low birth rates: The Chinese
   situation, and comparison with other countries
SO TIME & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Institutional change; population decline; birth rates; aging of the
   population; human genetic diversity
ID POPULATION DECLINE; FERTILITY; FUTURE; GROWTH; FAMILY
AB Despite fears of global overpopulation, population declines are becoming a significant demographic problem in developed and rapidly developing countries. If we have no effective measures to solve the problem, the world's population will continue to age, and some small ethnic groups will face a risk of extinction. The human race's social and genetic diversity therefore face significant challenges. The failure to raise birth rates in developed regions suggests that preventing adverse consequences from the population decline will not depend on our good intentions or on new technology, but rather on recognition of the problems resulting from an evolved institution based on low birth rates. Changing this institution will require us to enhance the social status of women, but will also require practical recognition of their unique needs in the context of childbearing and raising children. However, this innovation represents a huge challenge to overcome because of human resistance to change of existing institutions.

AB Smallholder dairy production is increasingly becoming popular in Jimma town. However, feed shortage is a major constraint to dairy production. The objectives of this study was to assess feed resources, feeding practices and farmers' perceived causes of feed shortage and coping strategies to feed scarcity in smallholder dairy producers in Jimma town, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. A total of 54 randomly selected dairy farmers were interviewed using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and through direct observations. Twenty major feed types used by dairy farmers were identified and categorized into five classes: natural pasture grazing, green feeds, hay, concentrate (commercial mix and agro-industrial by-products) and non-conventional feed resources. Green feeds-fresh or succulent grasses and legumes (mean rank = 0.361), concentrate (0.256), hay (0.198), non-conventional feeds (0.115) and natural pasture grazing (0.070) were ranked as the main feed resources in that order of importance. Green feed (94.4 % of the respondents) was found to be the main basal diet of dairy cattle. Overall, wheat bran (85.2 % of the respondents), commercial concentrate (55.6 %), noug (Guizotia abyssinica) cake (20.4 %), cotton seed cake (7.4 %) and molasses (7.4 %) were the main concentrate supplements used (P > 0.05). Local brew waste (attela) (77.8 % of the respondents), bean and pea hulls (42.6 %) enset (Ensete ventricosum) leaf and pseudo-stem (37 %), sugarcane tops (33.3 %), banana leaf and stem/stover (16.7 %) and papaya stem (16.7 %) were the dominant non-conventional feed resources in the surveyed area (P > 0.05). About 79.6, 7.4, 1.9 and 11.1 % of the farmers used zero-, semi-zero-, and the combination of zero-and semi-zero-and free-grazing systems, respectively. Most farmers (90.7 %) offered concentrate supplements to milking cows. However, supplementation did not consider milk yield, physiological status and condition of cows. All the farmers (100 %) offered common salt to their cattle as mineral supplement. The majority (98.1 %) of the farmers experience feed shortage in the dry season. Land scarcity (55.6 % of the respondents) was reported as the most important cause of feed scarcity followed by a combination of land scarcity and poor feed availability (42.2 %). Increasing use of agro-industrial by-products and commercial concentrate mix (87 % of the respondents), increasing use of hay (74.1 %), increasing use of non-conventional feeds (50 %), purchasing green feeds (19.8 %) and reducing herd size (2.7 %) were the strategies adopted for coping with feed scarcity. From results of this study, it could be concluded that to ensure sustainable availability of dairy cattle feed in the surveyed area, technological, technical and institutional innovations would be vital.

AB BACKGROUND: Over half of the world's children suffer from poor nutrition, and as a consequence they experience delays in physical and mental health, and cognitive development. There is little data evaluating the effects of delivery of lipid-based, nutrition supplementation on growth and development during pregnancy and early childhood within the context of a scaled-up program. Furthermore, there is limited evidence on effects of scaled-up, home-visiting programs that focus on the promotion of child development within the context of an existing, national nutrition program.
   METHODS/DESIGN: The MAHAY ("smart" in Malagasy) study uses a multi-arm randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to test the effects and cost-effectiveness of combined interventions to address chronic malnutrition and poor child development. The arms of the trial are: (T-0) existing program with monthly growth monitoring and nutritional/hygiene education; (T-1) is T0 + home visits for intensive nutrition counseling within a behavior change framework; (T-2) is T-1 + lipid-based supplementation (LNS) for children 6-18 months old; (T-3) is T2 + LNS supplementation of pregnant/lactating women; and (T-4) is T1 + intensive home visiting program to support child development. There are anticipated to be n = 25 communities in each arm (n = 1250 pregnant women, n = 1250 children 0-6 months old, and n = 1250 children 6-18 months old). Primary outcomes include growth (length/height-for-age z-scores) and child development (mental, motor and social development). Secondary outcomes include care-giver reported child morbidity, household food security and diet diversity, micro-nutrient status, maternal knowledge of child care and feeding practices, and home stimulation practices. We will estimate unadjusted and adjusted intention-to-treat effects. Study protocols have been reviewed and approved by the Malagasy Ethics Committee at the Ministry of Health in Madagascar and by the institutional review board at the University of California, Davis. This study is funded by the Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF), the World Bank Innovation Grant, the Early Learning Partnership Grant, the Japan Scaling-up for Nutrition Trustfund, and Grand Challenges Canada. The implementation of the study is financed by Madagascar's National Nutrition Office.

AB With the increasing popularity of the Internet, financial institutions are seeking ways to utilize this popular medium in an effort to keep up with the changing technological preferences of their customers through innovations like Internet banking services. In Uganda, however, the rate of Internet banking adoption has not risen as strongly as expected due to factors like lack of trust, security, poor perceptions on usefulness and ease of use of the system by the customers, lack of privacy over the Internet and poor attitude towards Internet banking, among others, which has led many to view Internet banking as a very risky undertaking. This study introduces perceived trustworthiness as one of the beliefs that may significantly influence Internet banking adoption and we examine its importance in determining customers' attitude and behavioral intention towards using Internet banking as the purpose of the study. We conducted a survey by distributing questionnaires to customers of five highly competitive banks in Uganda and collected data from a total of 232 respondents. The results of the statistical analyses using structural equation modeling indicate that the relative importance of perceived trustworthiness of banks was statistically significant as it accounted for 47 percent of variance in predicting customers' attitude towards Internet banking.

AB This study investigates transactions in the local coffee markets in Ethiopia. While the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange, which was established in 2008, introduced regulatory, institutional, and organizational innovations in the coffee market, informal norms and conventions remain the primary institutions governing transactions in the local markets. Based on a choice experiment, we found that for coffee farmers the characteristics of the traders are more important than the price offered when anchoring their transactions into personal relationships. This can be explained as the institutional response of farsighted calculative farmers to poorly organized coffee markets and to lacking credit and insurance markets. Contrary to the concept of embeddedness, which claims that economic transactions are embedded into social relationships, social relationships are observed to be embedded into economic relationships. One of the perverse effects of these personal relationship-based transactions is that farmers are insufficiently incentivized to maintain and improve coffee quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB National 'green growth' strategies, which aim at decoupling economic development from adverse environmental impacts, have become a new paradigm for policymakers in developing countries. Many green growth strategies are based on policy instruments designed to incentivize the domestic deployment of relatively mature clean technologies and aim at fostering the formation of a local industry to develop and produce these technologies. While the empirical evidence on the localization effect of such policies in developing countries is mixed, there is a dearth of research systemically analyzing how differences between technologies affect patterns of localization, which could explain the observed variance. We address this gap and develop a typology which distinguishes four types of technologies requiring different types of capabilities. We do so by combining insights from the literature on technology transfer and catching-up of industries with insights from the literature on patterns of innovation across the technology life-cycle. We apply this typology to the case of low-emission development strategies and four exemplary low-carbon technologies, namely small and micro hydro power, wind turbines, electric cars, and solar cells, in order to analyze capability requirements, innovation patterns, and the effect of past deployment policies on industry localization. We synthesize these case studies and derive a heuristic to anticipate the localization effects of deployment policies for different types of technologies in countries with varying income levels. We argue that the heuristic can serve as starting point for policymakers aiming at clean technology industry localization. The paper concludes with a discussion of possible technology-specific green growth strategies for developing countries with different income levels and for international institutions supporting green growth.

AB Using formal survey data from textile and leather product manufacturing firms in Ethiopia, we investigate how the current national cultural setup (power distance, collectivism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance) is affecting organizational learning, orientation and product innovation performance. Further, we assess the moderating role of sector and ownership structure on the interrelationship. The result demonstrates that the current national culture setup is negatively affecting the learning and innovation activities of the firms in the country. It also shows that while sector type is neutral, ownership type significantly affects the interrelationship among culture, learning orientation and product innovation performance.

AB Introduction. The global economy develops cyclically, which means that a rise is followed by recession. The main task of the government is to maintain favourable conditions for business development in order to ensure GDP growth and formation Ukraine's economy outstripping development contributing to its industrial development.
   The purpose of the paper is to determine factors of enterprises' outstripping development in order to support an innovative model and promote Ukraine's economic growth.
   Results. The author has analysed a number of countries with the highest number of profitable enterprises and compared their ratings with the ratings of developing countries according to information by Bloomberg. Based on this, the author has established patterns that are associated with the outstripping development of enterprises. It is noted that the USA, China and Russia have the largest number of profitable companies. It has been determined that China is a country with outstripping development; the USA is a leading country with regard to development, and Russia is a country with catching-up development. Various types of activities were defined with respect to the most profitable enterprises, including the oil and gas industry (before 2015), the financial sector and production of computers, electronic and optical products, the automotive and pharmaceutical industry. The article deals with factors of outstripping development of enterprises forming at macro-, meso-, and micro-levels. It was found that the level of outstripping development of enterprises in conditions of global economic crisis determine such factors, as: political stability in the country, the level of education and training, social responsibility, government policy in the field of innovation and investment development, type of economic activity, policy of local authorities in the field of innovation and investment development, social and production infrastructure development, consideration of production needs of enterprises by research and development institutions, elaboration of development strategies, financial condition of enterprises, level of organisational culture, innovation activity of enterprises and type of innovation.
   Conclusions. The global crisis negatively affects the outstripping development of enterprises, slowing down the innovation development through the production of traditional goods, predominance of imports of innovations to exports, narrowing the capacity of the domestic and global markets, a lowering the level of social guarantees, the willingness of the authorities to obtain investment from international organisations. To promote an outstripping development of enterprises, it is essential to provide a clearly formulated strategy of enterprises' development, a high level of organisational culture, an active use of innovation in production and management, continuous and multi-level training, human intelligence, knowledge and experience to develop new technologies, adopt innovative solutions, conquer new markets, promote the policy of local authorities towards support of investment and innovation development of a territory. All these actions would establish a basis for setting-up a breakthrough strategy and contribute to the prevalence of 6 and 7 technological modes in society and a high level of customer satisfaction.

AB Many different approaches are needed to achieve reductions in GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Carbon emissions trading schemes (ETSs) are widely used in industry and are effective in reducing the overall social cost of emissions abatement. This article reports the development of a downstream ETS for the transportation sector and its application in Shenzhen, China. The ETS was devised as a mandatory cap-and-trade scheme and, as a first step, was applied to public transportation. An integrated cap was set on the total emissions from buses and taxis: an absolute cap for existing vehicles and a relative increment for new entrants. Allowances were allocated by grandfathering or benchmarking and a 'reverse mechanism' was established to encourage the transformation of urban transportation to a low-carbon system. Online fuel consumption monitoring was used to quantify the emissions from vehicles, and the operators were required to surrender enough allowances or credits to account for their verified annual emissions. The mechanisms for allowance trading and carbon offsets provided sufficient flexibility to make emissions abatement and the use of new-energy vehicles and environmentally friendly travel within Shenzhen's urban transportation system economically attractive.
   Policy relevance
   The transportation sector is becoming a major contributor to the growth in China's GHG emissions. Achieving large reductions in GHG emissions from the transportation sector is a great challenge and requires both technology and policy innovation. The tradable carbon permit is a popular concept in mitigating climate change, but the introduction of a cap-and-trade ETS into the transportation sector is a relatively innovative concept. Shenzhen has launched the first cap-and-trade ETS in a developing country and is currently exploring ways to mitigate carbon emissions by a downstream cap-and-trade ETS for the transportation sector. This article considers the main institutional arrangements and regulatory framework of Shenzhen's transportation carbon ETS. It not only refreshes the theoretical analysis and practical application of downstream cap-and-trade carbon emissions trading in urban transportation, but also provides developing countries with a cost-effective instrument to mitigate their rapid growth in traffic carbon emissions during urbanization.

AB Purpose: As part of the institutional reforms and agricultural restructuring in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), this paper provides an assessment of the performance of the agricultural extension system as well as factors explaining it.
   Method: This paper involves key informants' interviews and surveys of 107 extension organizations and 162 extension agents in randomly selected 156 villages, analyzed using qualitative and logistic regression methods.
   Findings and Practical Implications: Results show that despite having one of the highest extension agent-to-farmer ratio and a pluralistic extension system, DRC fails to deliver knowledge and technologies to rural areas due to lack of coordination, no unified and clear policy and mandate, lack of funding, aging and low competencies of agents, and lack of mobility and interactions of agents with key actors. This paper complements findings by other studies that number of agents is not a sufficient indication of performance, but an effective system needs to focus on the enabling environment for agents to be motivated to work as mandated. In this paper, enabling conditions that are found to be statistically significant are external funding, enforcement of performance targets, systems of rewards and sanctions, mobility to foster linkages, and skills development.
   Originality: This paper contributes by: (1) analyzing a cross-section of various organizations and agents to identify factors that explain variations in performance in a statistical and systematic approach; (2) providing insights on how to prioritize investments and options for a fragile state like DRC, with weak infrastructure and institutional capacity and with a long history of neglect for their national extension system; and (3) illustrating how a rich and well-cited conceptual framework can be implemented empirically to provide policy options for a country like DRC.

AB Indigenous firms in developing countries with large domestic markets have unique advantages: the low end provides "natural" protection from foreign competition, while higher-end segments provide incentives for foreign firms to localize activities and develop channels for future capability building. Paradoxically, in their eagerness to support development efforts of local firms, states often nullify these advantages and limit the opportunities and capabilities that local firms can leverage in the upgrading process. Using the case studies of three large industrial sectors in China that faced similar prospects but had widely different outcomes, this paper develops a framework for understanding how policy shapes the growth and segmentation of markets, and thus the opportunity for industrial upgrading of indigenous firms. The cases show how restrictive demand-and supply-side policies often inadvertently limited the opportunities for upgrading through their effect on the availability of know-how, inputs, and resources required for industrial upgrading (the supply side), and through their effect on the incentives for upgrading (the demand side). Given that each segment is a crucial rung on the development ladder, industrial upgrading efforts stall when state policy inadvertently knocks out rungs on the development ladder.

TI Results-Based Financing in Mozambique's Central Medical Store: A Review
   After 1 Year
SO GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Public health commodity supply chains are typically weak in low-income countries, partly because they have many disparate yet interdependent functions and components. Approaches to strengthening supply chains in such settings have often fallen short-they address technical weaknesses, but not the incentives that motivate staff to perform better.
   Methods: We reviewed the first year of a results-based financing (RBF) program in Mozambique, which began in January 2013. The program aimed to improve the performance of the central medical store-Central de Medicamentos e Artigos Medicos (CMAM)-by realigning incentives. We completed in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 33 key informants, including representatives from CMAM and donor agencies, and collected quantitative data on performance measures and use of funds.
   Implementation: The RBF agreement linked CMAM performance payments to quarterly results on 5 performance indicators related to supply planning, distribution planning, and warehouse management. RBF is predicated on the theory that a combination of carrot and stick-i. e., shared financial incentives, plus increased accountability for results-will spur changes in behavior. Important design elements: (1) indicators were measured against quarterly targets, and payments were made only for indicators that met those targets; (2) targets were set based on documented performance, at levels that could be reasonably attained, yet pushed for improvement; (3) payment was shared with and dependent on all staff, encouraging teamwork and collaboration; (4) results were validated by verifiable data sources; and (5) CMAM had discretion over how to use the funds.
   Findings: We found that CMAM's performance continually improved over baseline and that CMAM achieved many of its performance targets, for example, timely submission of quarterly supply and distribution planning reports. Warehouse indicators, such as inventory management and order fulfillment, proved more challenging but were nonetheless positive. By linking payments to periodic verified results, and giving CMAM discretion over how to spend the funds, the RBF agreement motivated the workforce; focused attention on results; strengthened data collection; encouraged teamwork and innovation; and ultimately strengthened the central supply chain.
   Conclusion: Policy makers and program managers can use performance incentives to catalyze and leverage existing investments. To further strengthen the approach, such incentive programs can shift attention from quantity to quality indicators, improve verification processes, and aim to institutionalize the approach.

AB Cloud computing has emerged as an important ICT (information and communication technology) innovation that could potentially revolutionize the way computing resources are consumed and provided. In emerging economies, such innovation is regarded as the new way to provide information infrastructure that has the potential for further economic upgrading. In this paper, we investigate the initiation and growth process of the cloud computing industry in China, based on an in-depth case study. We discover that the development of China's cloud computing industry that emerged from an initial concept involves the co-evolution of technological and institutional infrastructure leading to a preliminary cloud ecosystem. We also find that such a process involves a wide range of different actors, from the government side to the business side, the interaction among which, in pursuing their own interests, drive the development of the cloud computing industry into being. Finally, situated in the institutional context of China, the government business relationship is witnessed to have changed and evolved along development of such an emerging industry, demonstrating the important and unique roles of both sides in industrial (or even national) wide diffusion of the ICT innovation.

AB The challenge for universities in developing countries of Latin America is to provide quality education and to promote the development of the digital competencies necessary for an active citizenship. Nevertheless, the use of technology and open educational resources (OER) promote greater efficiency and social penetration. The objective of this research is to analyze how the attributes of innovation develop when OER are integrated with learning environments that promote digital skills. Case study and data recollection were applied to the interview, the log, the observation, and the document analysis. Results indicated that a combination of innovation attributes generates a change in: a) educational methodology, b) technological tools and ways to present its contents, and c) the way the teacher thinks and students act. The use of innovative elements allowed subjects to overcome space and time barriers, setting the foundation for the development of blended learning in the institution.

AB Continuing the focus on military doctrine in this special issue, this essay explores institutional mechanisms that enable otherwise rigid bureaucracies to innovate. Rather than focus on organizational and strategic culture, the piece explores the role of pragmatic officers using incubators and advocacy networks to escape their iron cage. The piece traces the institutional origins of the US counterinsurgency doctrine between 2003 and 2006 to highlight the role of special study groups and cross-cutting bureaucratic coalitions in creating a space to deliberate over how to fight the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

AB This study assesses the impact of cooperative membership among dairy producers in Selale, Ethiopia. We selected ten impact indicators: proportion of dairy income to total household income, total dairy income, proportion of crossbreed cows to the total number of cows in the herd (indicator of technological innovation), amount of feed bought (another indicator of technological innovation), milk production, milk productivity, commercialization, price per liter of milk, price per kg of butter and the share of milk production that is processed at the household level. In order to minimize the biases that may arise by simply comparing members and non-members, we employed a propensity score matching technique. The empirical analysis shows that cooperatives are strong in facilitating technological transformations and commercialization but weak in offering better prices. These findings suggest structural trade-offs between different domains of cooperatives' action. Overall, our study concludes that cooperatives can be efficient business institutions to foster rural development and food security. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main objective of this paper was to analyze the driving forces that enhance farm households' decision to adopt agricultural innovations and the implications of these decisions on household food security. Maize variety diversity, soil and water conservation and improved storage or combinations of these accounted for 98% of agricultural innovations followed by the farmers in the study area. Using data from 892 randomly sampled households obtained from six districts of Malawi, the research employed a maximum simulated likelihood estimation of a multinomial endogenous treatment effect model to account for unobservable heterogeneity that influences technology adoption decision and maize productivity. Results revealed considerable heterogeneity in the choice of agricultural innovations practiced by smallholder farmers ranging from none to all practices within their fields. For instance 24% adopted improved maize varieties and storage; 14% improved maize, soil and water conservation, 14% improved maize only and 36% practiced all the technologies while 12% practiced none. In addition, the results showed that spouse's education, marital status, religion and informal networks are important factors in shaping women's participation in agricultural technology choice decisions. Exposure to production shocks such as drought, access to input and output markets, land size and gender of the plot manager of the plots explained the variation in farmers' propensities to adopt agricultural innovations. Respondents from drought prone areas, with small land size had higher incentives to adopt all the agricultural technologies as risk minimizing strategies. Conversely, farmers from high potential regions with bigger land sizes and higher asset and crop diversity indexes were less likely to adopt these agricultural innovations. Overall, adoption of improved maize and storage technologies resulted in significant increase in maize output per unit area though it may be important for researchers and policy makers to understand the social and institutional settings in which the technology is targeted, to benefit both men and women farmers equally.

AB This study analyzes the performance of Indonesian R&D institutions based on R&D productivity. By applying an institutional approach, the effects of collective determinants such as quality of researcher, R&D budgets, locations and ages of R&D institutions on productivity are considered. Our findings show that these performance variables had strong and significant effects on R&D productivity. A national innovation system should be developed in developing countries with different models from those used in developed countries. The non-economic dimension is essential in developing national innovation systems in developing countries such as Indonesia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The role of industry associations in shaping policy through various lobbying activities is well established. In most cases, while such activities are deemed essential from an industry perspective, they also carry negative connotations connected to narrow rent-seeking and the pursuit of elites' interests which run counter to the public good and discourage competition and subsequent innovation. As such, industry associations have long been excluded from discussions regarding the relational dynamics and evolution of innovation systems. In contrast, this paper builds upon more recent work that places industry associations as key intermediary actors that facilitate knowledge exchange and institutional capacity building, particularly in the context of developing countries where limited institutional capacities and substantial knowledge gaps can limit both innovation and development. Employing a qualitative cross-national comparison, this paper examines the changing roles and activities of biopharmaceutical industry associations in the development of the South African and Indian pharmaceutical industries, with a particular focus on government industry relations. For doing so, the paper captures developments during three main periods through which both the South African and Indian biopharmaceutical industries have similarly evolved, although within different national contexts: (1) pre-liberalization, (2) expanding pluralism, and (3) increasing partnership. We argue that in South Africa and India, particular historical trajectories and lack of institutional capacities are shifting industry associations away from ineffective lobbying to a new political approach that emphasizes partnering with government in the pursuit of not only narrow industry objectives, but also broader development aims.

AB With globalisation and a rapidly changing environment, the higher education sector in developing countries is facing challenges that require extraordinary leaders. Innovation is important for organisations, particularly in learning environments. Transformational leadership (TL) has been found to have an important influence on innovation, leading to increased goal-directed behaviour on the part of followers, promoting organisational change, and a spirit of trust, and helping followers to exceed their performance expectations. This research aimed to examine the impact of TL on product and process innovation, and the differences between these impacts in public and private higher education institutions (HEIs) in Iraq. Questionnaires and interviews were administered to 439 teaching staff and 10 leaders from private and public HEIs. Employing multi-group structural equation modelling (SEM) with AMOS 20, the research showed that TL plays a pivotal role in enhancing product and process innovation and that the style would be ideal in an Iraqi educational context as it would promote strategies for developing innovation in both sectors. The interviews revealed that there are similarities and differences between public and private HEIs in Iraq regarding the relationship between TL and both product and process innovation. Guidelines are developed for researchers as well as leaders, and evidence is provided in support of the use of TL to increase product and process innovation within higher education in developing countries, particularly Iraq. The implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB The World Trade Organization's (WTO) Ministerial Conference at Bali in December 2013 seemed to have marked a landmark moment in the history of the negotiations of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). This article begins with a brief analysis of why the DDA has been quagmired in deadlocks and become the longest running trade round in the history of the multilateral trading system. It then discusses the significance of what was achieved at the Bali Ministerial in light of repeated failures and particularly from the perspective of the world's poorest countries. It explains why and how breakthroughs were achieved and highlights several important institutional innovations. Lastly, it discusses how sustainable these innovations might be.

AB Purpose - The process of innovation in developing countries is different from that of developed countries, with mature technologies often being adopted with limited success. Universities are increasingly being viewed by policymakers as engines of innovation through the technology transfer office (TTO). However, with the adoption of various new intellectual property right legislation, university TTOs in developing countries have had an inefficient approach to technology transfer. Framed in the above premises, this study aims to develop a Maturity Model to measure, through non-monetary indicators, the efficiency of TTOs.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Maturity Model is inspired by the Berkley (PM) 2 Model which allows an organization to determine strengths and weaknesses and to focus on weak practices to achieve higher maturity. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process is adopted to determine the priorities and weights of the non-monetary indicators because they are ambiguous.
   Findings - The Maturity Model to measure the efficiency of TTO cover the following efficiency areas: intellectual property strategy and policy; organization design and structure; human resource; technology; industry links; and networking. The model provides a theoretical continuum along which the process of maturity can be developed incrementally in TTO from one level to the next, moving from awareness, defined, managed, integrated and sustained stage.
   Research limitations/implications - The Maturity Model needs to be tested and applied in TTOs in developing countries.
   Practical implications - The Maturity Model provides a means to sustain the decision-making process more effectively, especially in those countries considered as an inefficient innovator.
   Originality/value - The findings inform the design of a customizable solution to barriers to the success of technology transfer and highlight weaknesses within each institution or TTOs efficiency.

AB Purpose - Technological outsourcing requires possessing the technological capability level by enterprises taking the outsourced activity and further mandates build-up capabilities. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing nations such as Ethiopia are usually equipped with low level of technological capability and could benefit from government-supported or government-initiated outsourcing networks. The current study aims to preliminarily assess performance of outsourcing initiative taken by the Hibret Manufacturing and Machine Building Industry, a subsidiary of a national corporation, in developing technological capability of SMEs in Ethiopia.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study used a qualitative research approach through interviews with the parent company officials and owners of SMEs and site visit to these SMEs. Findings are organized in a way to draw lessons to be learned from technological outsourcing examined.
   Findings - Technological learning, acquisition of new technologies, market access and process innovation are few capabilities achieved by the involved SMEs. To facilitate and harness these opportunities and further assist in policy ratification, a conceptual framework has been presented and elaborated.
   Research limitations/implications - Further investigation into outsourcing procedure and biases are expected to shed further light onto the outsourcing initiative by the parent company. This study drew results from investigation of the SMEs involved. Additional investigation of other SMEs is expected to reveal additional insights.
   Originality/value - There is a dearth of literature focusing on exploration of technological outsourcing in low-income developing countries, such as Ethiopia, to build SMEs' technological capabilities. This research presents insightful contribution to strategic outsourcing to build local technological capability in developing economies.

DE China's new normal; development strategies; consumer spending; trade

ID VEHICLE OWNERSHIP; CONSUMPTION; WORLDWIDE
AB China's move towards a new normal has been motivated by domestic factors and accelerated by the decline in export opportunities to developed countries. This decline, combined with the knock-on effects of China's growth adjustments, is disrupting the favourable external environment that made developing countries' export-led development strategies viable. This paper concentrates on a rebalancing of developing countries' growth strategies towards a greater weight of household consumption as a potential alternative and discusses three challenges - market size, domestic purchasing power and balance-of-payments constraints. Concentrating on the latter, it analyses changes in sectoral compositions of consumer demand and patterns of international trade. Results point to the risk that a shift in growth strategy causes an import surge. The paper's findings indicate the scope and speed of required product innovation that would prevent a rebalancing of growth strategies towards a greater role of consumption from running into balance-of-payments constraints.

AB Tanzania has ambitions of moving from a mere consumer of information and communication technologies to a designing and manufacturing base. This paper aims to assess the role of public-private partnerships with Chinese institutions in the achievement of this goal. Through an in-depth case study, this paper examines the contributions of three Chinese multinationals in terms of technology transfer and technological capacity building in local firms in Tanzania. The analysis contrasts the organisation of improvements on the manner of technology transfer and capacity building in these partnerships with prior Sino-Tanzanian partnership efforts in technology and industry. The Chinese multinationals had a labour localisation rate of 60% on average, with some training services provided to Tanzanian nationals and supply of services and equipment to Tanzanian firms. However, the overall level of technology transfer continues to be weak. Observed barriers to technology transfer include weak incentives for collaboration between Chinese and Tanzanian firms and low-level technology embedded in activities offshored by the Chinese multinationals to Tanzania.

AB Purpose - Developing a global business model requires a clear understanding of the market conditions in the global marketplace. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of emerging market conditions on the key building blocks of Osterwalder's business model canvas.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper explains the basic framework of Osterwalder's business model and evaluation of relevant dimensions of emerging market characteristics and the effect of these dimensions on creating global business models in emerging markets.
   Findings - Global business models in emerging market must evaluate and account for important market conditions, such as the power of non-governmental institutions, the effect of clientelism and prevalence of informal institutional flux.
   Practical implications - When developing a global business model, researchers and managers should understand market conditions will not only shape the cost structure and revenue stream but also make a company to change its value proposition entirely.
   Originality/value - The main value of this paper is recognizing and assessing the effects of emerging market conditions on Osterwalder's business model framework.

AB Purpose - There has been an increased interest in the role of the financial sector and institutional quality in the development process.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper addresses the relationship between corruption and financial sector development by constructing a Schumpeterian endogenous growth model, allowing for the entry of competitive firms with an explicit role for politics and banking.
   Findings - Assuming that technologically advanced firms are located in developed countries and backward firms in developing countries, the model in this study suggests that low corruption are more growth enhancing in the former group of countries. Better institutions stimulate entry by reducing banking screening costs and entry is more growth enhancing in sectors closer to the technological frontier.
   Research limitations/implications - The model in this study is a partial equilibrium analysis and one should include a role for labour markets to address the household's problem and enrich the model's conclusions. Secondly, the model specification rests on the fact that the degree of corruption is correlated with the level of institutions. Even though this might be subject to some criticism, this is a common practice across the literature and so, it is clearly a matter of taste.
   Practical implications - The main policy conclusion is that anti-corruption policy initiatives should prioritize corruption that distorts incentives with respect to productive investment that directly and negatively affects growth.
   Originality/value - This paper addresses the relationship between corruption and financial sector development by constructing a Schumpeterian endogenous growth model, allowing for the entry of competitive firms with an explicit role for politics and banking.

   ADDRESS
AB Mainstreaming climate change and future uncertainty into rural development planning in developing countries is a pressing challenge. By taking a complex systems approach to decision-making, the adaptation pathways construct provides useful principles. However, there are no examples of how to operationalise adaptation pathways in developing countries, or how to evaluate the process. This paper describes a 4 year governance experiment in Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia, which applied adaptive co-management (ACM) as a governance approach to 'prime' a transformation to adaptation pathways-based development planning. The project's Theory of Change (ToC) consisted of three causally-linked phases which mirrored the evolutionary stages of ACM: priming stakeholders, enabling policies and programs, and implementing adaptation. The first phase established a trans-disciplinary research team to act as facilitators and brokers, a multi-stakeholder planning process demonstrating adaptation pathways practice, and trialling of 'no regrets' adaptation strategies in case study sub-districts. A participatory evaluation method was designed to test the ToC's assumptions and measure ACM outcomes. Stakeholder interviews at the project's closure indicated that through ACM, stakeholders had been successfully primed: leaders emerged, trust, cross-scale social networks and knowledge integration grew, communities were empowered, and innovative adaptation strategies were developed and tested. However, there was limited evidence of institutional change to existing planning processes. This was attributed to the absence of policy windows due to ineffective and insufficient time for political engagement, and the fluid institutional environment caused by a national decentralisation policy. To enhance the priming of adaptation pathways into development planning under these conditions, three recommendations are made: (1) provide long term support for emergent leaders and brokers to become 'policy entrepreneurs' who can capitalise on policy windows when they appear, (2) establish and support local livelihood innovation niches as 'bridgeheads' for ACM, and (3) maintain participatory evaluation amongst primary stakeholders to re-kindle ACM.

AB Access to financial service has become a key phenomenon for economic development and poverty alleviation. Microfinance is one way of fighting poverty in Sudan, where most citizens are in need of it. However, despite the initial results showing a positive impact of microfinance on the livelihood of low-income people in Sudan, around 8 million of the Sudanese poor people are excluded from microfinance services. One potential remedy for the limited outreach of microfinance in Sudan may lie within enhancing the capacity of microfinance services providers (MFPs) in the utilization of modern technology. Recent innovation in providing financial services in a convenient and efficient way is the use of mobile banking (m-banking) technology in microfinance. M-banking promises to increase the efficiency and outreach of microfinance services in developing countries. This paper tries to examine the factors that influence the adoption of m-banking by microfinance sector in Sudan. In this respect, hypotheses were developed guided by Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Technology-organization-Environment (TOE) models. Primary data were collected from MFPs and microfinance customers in Sudan using questionnaires and interviews. The study contributes to knowledge in terms of methods used by extending aforementioned theories through adding new variables to both models by putting both models in one study to fill the gaps in past studies; via examination of the demand (customers) and supply (institutions) through modifying them to include new variables related to m-banking in microfinance.

TI How to Achieve Transparency in Public-Private Partnerships Engaged in
   Hunger and Malnutrition Reduction
SO HIDDEN HUNGER: MALNUTRITION AND THE FIRST 1,000 DAYS OF LIFE: CAUSES,
   CONSEQUENCES AND SOLUTIONS
SE World Review of Nutrition and Dietetics
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Multi-stakeholder partnerships are important facilitators of improving nutrition in developing countries to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Often, the role of industry is challenged and questions are raised as to the ethics of involving for-profit companies in humanitarian projects. The Second International Conference on Nutrition placed great emphasis on the role of the private sector, including industry, in multi-stakeholder partnerships to reduce hunger and malnutrition. Governments have to establish regulatory frameworks and institutions to guarantee fair competition and invest in infrastructure that makes investments for private companies attractive, eventually leading to economic growth. Civil society organizations can contribute by delivering nutrition interventions and behavioral change-related communication to consumers, providing capacity, and holding governments and private sector organizations accountable. Industry provides technical support, innovation, and access to markets and the supply chain. The greatest progress and impact can be achieved if all stakeholders cooperate in multi-stakeholder partnerships aimed at improving nutrition, thereby strengthening local economies and reducing poverty and inequality. Successful examples of public-private partnerships exist, as well as examples in which these partnerships did not achieve mutually agreed objectives. The key requirements for productive alliances between industry and civil society organizations are the establishment of rules of engagement, transparency and mutual accountability. The Global Social Observatory performed a consultation on conflicts of interest related to the Scaling Up Nutrition movement and provided recommendations to prevent, identify, manage and monitor potential conflicts of interest. Multi-stakeholder partnerships can be successful models in improving nutrition if they meet societal demand with transparent decision- making and execution. Solutions to the issue of malnutrition are available. We have the resources and knowledge, and we must act as a global community in the immediate future. Transparency about the roles and contributions of each partner may be a key factor for successful cooperation in multi-stakeholder partnerships. c 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate what types of open innovation search strategies are associated with internal innovation activities in family and non-family SMEs within natural resource-based clusters.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on an empirical analysis of a sample of 245 Chilean firms.
   Findings - Results suggest that while family and non-family SMEs do not significantly differ in terms of internal innovation activities, important differences exist in terms of open innovation search strategies. In particular, family SMEs search for new ideas and knowledge within their closest network of relationships (e.g. customers, suppliers and competitors), whereas non-family SMEs mainly focus on broader network relationships (e.g. universities, public institutions and fair trade organizations).
   Practical implications - This study shows that within a natural resource cluster, the types of firm do matter. In fact, family and non-family SMEs use different open innovation search strategies to innovate; hence, this research may help and assist policy makers in tailoring innovation policies aimed at expanding the potential benefits of clusters for regional growth and development.
   Originality/value - This research addresses the call to further investigate the link between family SMEs and innovation in developing countries, given that SMEs may also act as a lively player for regional development.

AB The Technology Executive Committee (TEC) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recently convened a workshop seeking to understand how strengthening national systems of innovation (NSIs) might help to foster the transfer of climate technologies to developing countries. This article reviews insights from the literatures on Innovation Studies and Socio-Technical Transitions to demonstrate why this focus on fostering innovation systems has potential to be more transformative as an international policy mechanism for climate technology transfer than anything the UNFCCC has considered to date. Based on insights from empirical research, the article also articulates how the existing architecture of the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism could be usefully extended by supporting the establishment of CRIBs (climate relevant innovation-system builders) in developing countries - key institutions focused on nurturing the climate-relevant innovation systems and building technological capabilities that form the bedrock of transformative, climate-compatible technological change and development.Policy relevanceThis article makes a direct contribution to current work by the TEC of the UNFCCC on enhancing enabling environments for and addressing barriers to technology development and transfer (specifically, it will contribute to Activity 4.3 of the TEC's 2014-15 rolling workplan Further work on enablers and barriers, taking into account the outcomes of the workshop on NSIs'). The article articulates both the conceptual basis that justifies a focus on NSIs in relation to climate technology transfer and makes concrete recommendations as to how this can be implemented under the Convention as a Party-driven extension to the existing architecture of the Technology Mechanism.

AB The purpose of this study is to understand how regulative, normative and cognitive institutions affect e-payment entrepreneurship in developing countries. Lack of e-payment technologies has been identified as a key constraint to e-commerce adoption and diffusion in the developing world. The availability of e-payment technologies in the developed world provides opportunities for their transfer to and adaptation in the developing world. However, research on attempts by governments or e-business entrepreneurs to provide e-payment innovations in the developing world and possible institutional effects on such initiatives remain limited. Drawing on interpretive case study methodology and the new institutional theory as a lens, this study traces an e-payment entrepreneurship attempt in the developing-country context of Ghana. The findings show that some national and international institutions encouraged the initiative. However, unclear regulations and bureaucratic processes of the Central Bank as well as the entrepreneur's own cognitive failure to consider contextual differences between the developed and the developing world constrained the initiative. The study advises developing-country e-business entrepreneurs to understand their local institutional environment and not assume that imported technologies will work the same way as in the developed world. It also calls on developing-country governments to promote clear regulations and streamline certification processes to encourage technological innovations such as e-payment.

AB Purpose - Given the increasing relevance of emerging economies in the global economy and the neoclassical argument that technological progress is the main driver of economic growth, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the under-researched role of informal institutions on the likelihood that individuals will enter into technology entrepreneurship in emerging markets.
   Design/methodology/approach - Since the authors combined individual-level and country-level observations, data were analyzed employing hierarchical linear modeling methods and random-effect logistic regressions to estimate the influence of country-level factors on the likelihood of individuals' entry into techno-entrepreneurship. The data set comprised 10,280 observations for 18 emerging countries during the 2002-2008 period.
   Findings - The selected informal institutions relate to techno-entrepreneurship as follows: the size of the shadow economy has a U-shaped relationship; ethnic diversity is positively associated; and ethnic polarization is negatively associated, though the latter is not significant.
   Research limitations/implications - The authors did not theorize on cross-level mechanisms through which these informal institutions could influence individual-level attitudes, nor did the authors assess the role of such institutions on general entrepreneurship. However, this paper provides a base for more fine-grained studies.
   Originality/value - The authors disseminate novel insights into the particularities of emerging economies since all informal institutions studied here have been negatively associated with the overall economic experiences of developing and least developed countries. In addition, the authors provide a unique contribution by identifying a potential U-shaped relationship between the size of the shadow economy and the likelihood of individuals engaging in techno-entrepreneurship.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to combine notions from the POST Model of Economic Geography and Learning Theory from International Business to study how firms may enhance their responsiveness to institutional processes and changes through different forms of international learning. Focussing on one form of institutional changes, namely pro-market reforms, the paper analyzes how firms may boost the potential benefits from such changes through international strategies that increase their access to knowledge spillovers and absorptive capacity. These strategies include international product diversification, enhancing innovation capabilities, informal institutional exposure, accumulated internationalization knowledge, and overall experiential knowledge.
   Design/methodology/approach - The hypotheses are tested using generalized least squares models with AR(1) panel-specific autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity correction. Based on the preliminary analyses performed in these studies, the author also executes a Hausman test, Bartlett's test, and James/Alexander's test. The results of these analyses indicate that the use of random effects is appropriate; that moderating effects are present; and that multivariate analyses using these moderators are suitable, respectively.
   Findings - The results indicate that pro-market reforms have a positive and significant effect on the profitability of firms from developing countries. Furthermore, they provide support for the positive moderating effects of international product diversification, innovation capabilities, informal institutional exposure, accumulated internationalization knowledge, and overall experiential knowledge. Together, these findings suggest that through their international strategic decisions, MNEs can enhance their access to knowledge and become more responsive to institutional changes in their home market.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper contributes to the economic geography literature by linking the POST Model with the classification of types of knowledge from Learning Theory. The paper analyzes how characteristics of place, organization, space, and time play a different role for each of the three basic types of knowledge that is relevant for international firms: institutional, business, and internationalization. Furthermore, the paper contributes to the literature on reforms and firm profitability by delving deeper into the moderating effect of strategic decisions on the relationship between reforms and firm performance. This allows us to have a deeper comprehension of how various sources of international learning may enhance the responsiveness of firms to institutional changes.
   Originality/value - The paper provides several important contributions to the international strategy literature. First, it contributes to Learning Theory by combining it with the POST Model of Economic Geography to study how each of the three sources of knowledge (and their subcomponents) can be further broken down into factors of place, organization, space, and time. Second, it contributes to the literature of institutional change by studying how knowledge acquired through vastly different means can provide firms with sources of competitive advantage over other local competitors when responding to institutional changes in their home market. Third, it contributes to the literature on reforms and profitability by studying five novel moderators of this relationship.

AB Purpose - The paper aims to investigate the standpoints and practices of university members from European developing countries regarding the harnessing of the intellectual capital (IC) within online academic social networks.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire-based survey with 210 university members was conducted, with the indicators adopting prior measurement scales which were further adapted to a network framework.
   Findings - The organizational policies and practices relate positively and highly significantly with the valuation of the network-based IC components. Moreover, 63 per cent of the professional and organizational competitiveness of higher education institutions is determined by the exploitation of the IC embedded in online academic networks.
   Research limitations/implications - All survey respondents were from the European developing countries, which may limit the general applicability of the findings. Also, the emphasis is laid solely on online academic networks. Practical implications - This paper brings to the fore both the potential and the state-of-the-art in leveraging the IC of online specialized networks which are indicative of the academic field. When acknowledged as such, the network-based IC is liable to generate substantial competitive advantages at the professional and organizational levels at the same time.
   Originality/value - This research adds to the extant literature in two main ways. First, it advances a new construct - network-based IC - in the context of the online academic social networks.

AB The article deals with the problem of substantiation of the emergent economies development regulatory measures (fiscal and / or monetary), using the evolutionary modelling methods. For this purpose, the mathematical model was constructed that simulates the co-evolution process of the advanced and developing countries, linked by global value chains. In this model, each country is characterized by its original structure of economic entities, defined by the ratio of the egoistic enterprises (predisposed to conservative behaviour) to the altruistic enterprises (predisposed to innovation), as well as by specific population and demographic processes. The results of the computational experiments have shown that the success of economic regulation fundamentally depends on the peculiarities of the initial state of the institutional environment. In the institutional environment with the "transparent" long behaviour and, accordingly, a long economic planning horizon, the best result in the form of average annual production growth rate of the emergent economies is provided by the cheap money policy combined with the high European taxes. A different situation is observed in more realistic short behaviour and, accordingly, short (under 5 years) economic planning horizon. In this case, any tax policy (neither low nor high taxes) together with any money (neither cheap nor expensive), to a certain extent loses its significance, as the initially backward innovative system does not allow to quickly get good results, and the long-term benefits of the potential economic growth are not taken into consideration. However, low taxes and cheap money are important as they create better conditions for survival of the altruistic enterprises, facilitating their investment activities, which can multiply increase their technical performance and economic efficiency. Still, in the context of the evolutionary economics and following the conducted computational experiments, the fiscal policy in terms of emerging markets retains its regulatory capacity, and therefore requires further reforms in the context of the "new reality" based on the global value chains.

AB Scientific and agricultural development approaches to improve the livelihoods of smallholder agriculturalists in developing countries are shifting from "linear transfer of technology models" towards "systems thinking". One manifestation of this shift is the recognition of agricultural innovations as multidimensional and co-evolutionary processes that integrate technological, organisational, socio-economic and institutional innovations. This paper attempts to test a new conceptual framework for evaluating innovation platforms for agrifood value chains. The framework is based on the structure-conduct-performance hypothesis of industrial organisation, in combination with concepts of new institutional economics and marketing relationships. Data to test the framework was collected from two innovation platforms in the Volta2 Project in Ghana. Both the qualitative and quantitative data collected validate a possible link between the structure of the platforms, the conduct of their members and the resulting market performance through reducing the transaction costs of search and information.

TI Integrated community case management in Malawi: an analysis of
   innovation and institutional characteristics for policy adoption

AB In 2007, Malawi became an early adopter of integrated community case management for childhood illnesses (iCCM), a policy aimed at community-level treatment for malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia for children below 5 years. Through a retrospective case study, this article explores critical issues in implementation that arose during policy formulation through the lens of the innovation (i.e. iCCM) and of the institutions involved in the policy process. Data analysis is founded on a documentary review and 21 in-depth stakeholder interviews across institutions in Malawi. Findings indicate that the characteristics of iCCM made it a suitable policy to address persistent challenges in child mortality, namely that ill children were not interacting with health workers on a timely basis and consequently were dying in their communities. Further, iCCM was compatible with the Malawian health system due to the ability to build on an existing community health worker cadre of health surveillance assistants (HSAs) and previous experiences with treatment provision at the community level. In terms of institutions, the Ministry of Health (MoH) demonstrated leadership in the overall policy process despite early challenges of co-ordination within the MoH. WHO, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and implementing organizations played a supportive role in their position as knowledge brokers. Greater challenges were faced in the organizational capacity of the MoH. Regulatory issues around HSA training as well as concerns around supervision and overburdening of HSAs were discussed, though not fully addressed during policy development. Similarly, the financial sustainability of iCCM, including the mechanisms for channelling funding flows, also remains an unresolved issue. This analysis highlights the role of implementation questions during policy development. Despite several outstanding concerns, the compatibility between iCCM as a policy alternative and the local context laid the foundation for Malawi's road to early adoption of iCCM.

AB This study investigates how the Ethiopian dairy innovation system hat functioned to support the development of the Ethiopian dairy sector and what have been the major technical, economic, and institutional constraints in the process. We used a coupled functional-structural analysis of innovation systems to analyse the influence of socioeconomic and policy constraints on the development of the Ethiopian dairy sector. Results show that problems with structural elements such as the absence of key actors, limited capacity of existing actors, insecure property rights, cumbersome bureaucratic processes, poor interaction among actors and inadequate infrastructure have all limited dairy innovation. Out of the seven innovation system functions studied, our findings show that entrepreneurship, knowledge diffusion, market development and legitimacy creation have been particularly weak. Our evidence thus suggests that problems with certain structural elements coupled with weaknesses in various innovation system functions have been major hindrances to the uptake of technologies and dairy sector development in Ethiopia. The narrow policy focus on biophysical technology generation and dissemination, without considering the underlying problems related to institutional conditions and socio-economic processes, has also contributed to low technology adoption and limited broader development in the dairy sector. We suggest that combinations of institutional and technological interventions are needed to overcome the various system weaknesses that have hindered dairy sector development in Ethiopia.

AB The African Community Access Programme is a research initiative for the rural transport sector in Africa. The programme is funded by the UK Department for International Development and by partner governments in Africa. The programme in turn has funded a wide range of research projects in the rural transport sector. It provides support to users of the research outputs at all stages of the uptake process. Users of these new ideas include national transport sector institutions, local government organisations, practitioners and community groups. Under the programme the uptake of new ideas and innovations has been most effective in the road engineering aspects of rural transport. This includes the adoption of new standards and specifications for low traffic roads. The rate of uptake is affected by the level of institutional maturity and cohesion in the participating countries, and how closely the innovation is aligned to sector policies and strategic plans. Particular success has been achieved when there is a champion for the idea in the user organisation. The programme has focused on effective communication of research findings to user groups and building a strong community of practice for the rural transport sector. Long-term support from the principal funder has been a key factor.

TI Building Science Community by Attracting Global Talents: The Case of
   Singapore Biopolis
SO SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Small developing countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa are still struggling with the institutionalisation and professionalisation of science. Many countries in these regions are yet to establish science communities. Singapore case becomes all the more interesting and exemplary as this small country was able to build a small but vibrant science community in relatively a short span of time. As will be shown through the case study on Biopolis' (cluster of modern biology laboratories and national university), there is indeed a unique Singaporean approach in building science community by attracting global talents. The process of attracting global talents or what may be seen as a case of brain gain was part of Singapore's national science, technology and innovation (STI) strategy since the 1980s and particularly the 1990s. After exploring the most salient features of STI policies, the essay will focus on two major institutional developments, which were crucial for building Biopolis, based science community. First is on building of world class university and research ecosystem; and second is a empirical research on the structure and composition of scientists in eight major biological labs.

AB Most observations of the patent behavior of firms are derived from institutional environments in which relatively strong protection can be obtained, even if patents per se are imperfect protection mechanisms. As a result, the determinants of a firm's propensity to patent in a weak appropriability regime are still unclear. This paper advances our current understanding of patent behavior by exploring the effects of manufacturing firms' innovation partnerships, foreign ownership, and adoption of new management practices on the likelihood of patenting. Our analysis is based on the responses of firms to questions in the Brazilian Industrial Survey of Technological Innovation (Pintec). The findings presented here indicate that, despite the weaknesses of the patent system, firms engaged in innovation-oriented collaborations are more likely to patent than firms not involved in these partnerships. Additionally, the results reveal that domestic and foreign firms in a weak institutional environment are similar in their inclination to patent. Finally, the empirical exercise shows that when a patent system is characterized by high levels of formalism and low levels of safeguarding against infringements of property rights firms adopt novel management practices as substitutes for patents.

AB Global industrialization is accelerated under the driving force of developing countries' rapid economic development. Water pollution is inevitably worsened due to lagging investment in basic treatment infrastructure. Wastewater treatment cannot rely on just one treatment technique, so research in this field has attracted much attention to satisfy stringent recovery and emissions standards increasingly imposed on industrial wastewater. This case study is a bibliometric analysis conducted to evaluate industrial wastewater treatment research from 1991 to 2014, based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) database. Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotechnology is the leading journal in this field, publishing 3.8 % of articles over this period, followed by Journal of Hazardous Materials and Water Research, the latter of which has the highest impact factor and h-index of all journals in this field. India and the Chinese Academy of Sciences were the most productive country and institution, respectively, while the USA, was the most internationally collaborative and had the highest h-index (82) of all countries. A new method named "word cluster analysis" was successfully applied to trace the research hotspots. Innovation in treatment methods is thought to relate to the growth in volume and increase in complexity of industrial wastewater, as well as to policy decisions in developing countries that encourage effective industrial wastewater treatment.

AB Finance in general, and banking in particular, are probably the only areas of the economic system where there is widespread agreement on the necessity of formal governance. Most governments reserve for themselves the right to issue debt in the form of coins and currency; in addition private providers of means of payment have failed so frequently to provide a safe and secure means of payment, with disastrous consequences for the operation of the real economy that governments have sought to regulate financial to prevent financial crisis. However, in an open global economy the regulations of national governments have little impact on the operation of global financial markets which are regulated by the governments of developed countries. Thus the regulations determined in developed country markets, in particular the US are of crucial importance to the governance of finance in developing countries. This paper considers the main innovations of developed country governance in the aftermath of the recent crisis, in particular capital requirements and macro prudential regulations and suggests that they are in fact not new regulatory provisions, but have been employed for some time with little succeeds and are thus not likely to shield developing countries for the financial instability caused by the failure of governance in developed country markets.

AB Adaptive governance is the use of novel approaches within policy to support experimentation and learning. Social learning reflects the engagement of interdependent stakeholders within this learning. Much attention has focused on these concepts as a solution for resilience in governing institutions in an uncertain climate; resilience representing the ability of a system to absorb shock and to retain its function and form through reorganisation. However, there are still many questions to how these concepts enable resilience, particularly in vulnerable, developing contexts. A case study from Uganda presents how these concepts promote resilient livelihood outcomes among rural subsistence farmers within a decentralised governing framework. This approach has the potential to highlight the dynamics and characteristics of a governance system which may manage change. The paper draws from the enabling characteristics of adaptive governance, including lower scale dynamics of bonding and bridging ties and strong leadership. Central to these processes were learning platforms promoting knowledge transfer leading to improved self-efficacy, innovation and livelihood skills. However even though aspects of adaptive governance were identified as contributing to resilience in livelihoods, some barriers were identified. Reflexivity and multi-stakeholder collaboration were evident in governing institutions; however, limited self-organisation and vertical communication demonstrated few opportunities for shifts in governance, which was severely challenged by inequity, politicisation and elite capture. The paper concludes by outlining implications for climate adaptation policy through promoting the importance of mainstreaming adaptation alongside existing policy trajectories; highlighting the significance of collaborative spaces for stakeholders and the tackling of inequality and corruption.

AB Innovation is of pivotal importance to economic growth in both developed and developing countries. The current research seeks to provide insights on how human and institutional factors interact to explain country variations in innovation. Using a multiple source, multinational database that covers a wide spectrum of innovation outputs in more than 120 economies in the world from 2011 to 2013, we for the first time examined both the concurrent and predictive associations of the interactive effects of human capital and institutional support with innovation output. Results showed that innovation output is a multi-faceted construct, consisting of at least three aspects: knowledge creation, knowledge impact, and knowledge diffusion. Quality of human capital predicts knowledge creation; institutional support and human capital have additive effects on knowledge impact; and the presence of both human capital and institutional support is required for knowledge diffusion. These results extend past findings on the role of institutions and human capital in innovation and have important implications for national policies of innovation development.

AB Public sector reforms are commonplace in developing countries. Much of the literature about these reforms reflects on their failures. This paper asks about the successes and investigates which of two competing theories best explain why some reforms are positive deviants: "solution- and leader-driven change" (SLDC) and "problem-driven iterative adaptation" (PDIA). The theories are used to analyze data emerging from a case survey involving thirty cases from Princeton University's Innovations for Successful Society (ISS) program. The bulk of evidence from this study supports a PDIA explanation, but there is reason to believe that SLDC hypotheses also have value. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The authors aim to contribute to the literature on subsistence marketplaces and the marketing field in general by exploring social innovation partnerships in a fragile country characterized by institutional gaps-specifically, by considering the role of cross-sector collaboration in conflict-affected areas. The empirical setting consists of coffee partnerships in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the authors collected data from and about companies, nongovernmental organizations, and cooperatives using both primary and secondary sources, including a field trip, interviews, and group discussions with farmers and their families. They show results at the organizational level (i.e., buildup of managerial capacities, transfer of financial-administrative skills, and improved functioning of cooperatives), the farmer level (i.e., better prices, livelihoods, and access to markets as well as increased revenues), and the community level (i.e., reduced tensions and collaboration between previously hostile groups as well as the creation of new governance modalities). The study suggests that partnerships may offer a systemic approach to addressing institutional gaps, which is necessary in such "extreme" contexts. The authors close with a discussion of further implications for research and public policy.

   insights from the Triple Helix and the institutional logics perspective

AB While the Triple Helix relationship between university, industry and government, called innovation in innovation' by Etzkowitz, has frequently been a key concept guiding national and regional innovation policies around the world, there is an emerging awareness that no one-size-fits-all approach can be used in developing innovation systems. Criticism has been expressed that the conceptualization of the Triple Helix model in the most recent literature pays little attention to contextual effects. The present article seeks to enhance the context sensitivity of the Triple Helix model by integrating it with the insights of institutional logics. More specifically, seven ideal' institutional logics aligned with ideal' Triple Helix activities in Western society are identified. These have a potential to be used as a conceptual/benchmarking framework for understanding how institutional settings, particularly institutional logics, influence the development of Triple Helix innovation systems in different national contexts. To verify such a proposition, some alternative Triple Helix models as well as associated institutional logics are compared to the ideal-type, demonstrating that different institutional logics may divert the Triple Helix interactions in other directions. Meanwhile, it is claimed that institutional logics do not necessarily lead to a Triple Helix model but serve only as enabling conditions. To what extent the Triple Helix will be developed depends on innovation policies and on the key actors involved in the innovation process. The framework constructed in this study aims to provide a solid basis from which policymakers, especially those from developing and transition countries, may improve the design of these innovation policies by employing appropriate Triple Helix approaches.

AB This paper provides an understanding of the regional determinants of research and development (R&D) institutions in India. R&D facilities locate across regions in response to factors such as: science and technology manpower availability, banking facilities, transport infrastructure, favorable real estate prices, state domestic product, patents, literacy, quality engineering colleges, higher education institutions, and investment via research and development expenditure. Further, R&D location brings regional change via industry location, employment and investment leading to regional economic development. The Indian government has pursued a balanced regional development strategy since the inception of planning in the 1950s. This strategy would need a dispersed location in geographical space. This policy changed to a market-oriented approach beginning in 1991. Various technology policy documents have emphasized upon 'promotion of science and technology research', 'attainment of technological competence', 'enlarging investment in R&D', and 'synergize science, technology and innovation'. To examine the trends of R&D this paper addresses the following four questions: (1) what are the regional patterns of R&D distribution in India? (2) what are the sector patterns of R&D distribution in India? (3) What determines the regional distribution of patents? (4) What determines the regional distribution of R&D in India during the periods 1988-1989, 1998-1999 and 2009-2010? Multiple regression models are run to estimate the determinants of R&D in geographical space.

TI Assessing climate change mitigation technology interventions by

DT Article
ID INNOVATION SYSTEMS
AB Accelerating the international use of climate mitigation technologies is key if efforts to curb climate change are to succeed, especially in developing countries, where weak domestic technological innovation systems constrain the uptake of climate change mitigation technologies. Several intergovernmental agencies have set up specific programmes to support the diffusion of climate mitigation technologies. Using a simplified technological innovation system-based framework, this paper aims to systematically review these programmes, with the dual aim of assessing their collective success in promoting technological innovation, and identifying opportunities for the newly formed UNFCCC Technology Mechanism. We conclude that, while all programmes reviewed have promoted technology transfer, they have given limited attention to innovation capabilities with users, government and universities. Functions that could be further developed include knowledge development, legitimation and market formation. These could be focal areas for the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism. We recommend that, in future programmes, part of the funding is dedicated to programmes doing research and development as well as capability development.

TI Industry associations, health innovation systems and politics of
   development: the cases of India and South Africa
SO BUSINESS AND POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the last 20 years, developing countries have witnessed the increased role of non-governmental actors such as health industry associations and umbrella organizations in the diffusion and governance of health innovation. Utilizing extensive interviews with actors in the Indian and South African health industries, this paper argues that, in a context of emerging pluralism - i.e., a dynamic context of bargaining between competing (public and private) interests and values - these associations constitute public actors that play dual roles in the politics of innovation and development. Specifically, not only do they engage downstream by diffusing knowledge to their respective health innovation systems in order to achieve common objectives, they also engage upstream with their governments to co-develop policies and regulations. This dual role of health industry associations and umbrella organizations makes them less neutral politically but more effective institutionally, and their innovative and political role should be seriously taken into account in the healthcare sector.

AB Proponents of global intellectual property rights (IPRs) reforms have argued that developing countries' weak IPRs limit their access to foreign innovative products and technologies. Central to our understanding of the effects of IPRs on product access is the influence of national differences in patent protection on corporate behavior and business strategy of multinational firms. Using detailed product data on US exports from 1990 to 2000, this research note assesses the impact of strengthening IPRs in developing countries on product variety of US exports. Colonial origin and cross-industry variation in patent effectiveness serve to identify the impact. The results show that the strengthening of IPRs increased exports of new products in patent-sensitive industries. The expansion in product variety accounted for the entire increase in US exports. The findings substantiate claims that ratification of TRIPS by developing countries promotes access to new foreign products and technologies. Additionally, the results demonstrate that patent protection is a significant institutional factor in US firms' business decisions over the introduction of new products and processes into a developing country marketplace.

AB The aim of this paper is to provide an updated survey of the "state of the art" in entrepreneurial studies with a particular focus on developing countries (DCs). In particular, the concept of "entrepreneurship" is critically discussed, followed by a discussion of the institutional, macroeconomic, and microeconomic conditions that affect the entry of new firms and the post-entry performance of newborn firms. The reviewed literature bears some policy implications for the support of the creation new firms, such as the targeting of policy measures to prospective entrepreneurs who possess high education levels, long previous job experience, and innovative skills. Specifically, for DCs, tailored subsidies and support should be coupled with framework and infrastructural policies that are able to improve the business environment such that new ventures can start and grow.

TI Does openness lead to sustained economic growth? Export growth versus
   other variables as determinants of economic growth

AB This research revisits the issue of economic growth determinants in developing countries with a focus on international integration variables. Four alternative variables are tested, namely, export growth, trade openness, export diversification, and foreign direct investment (FDI), in a single framework. This study finds that export growth is the most robust, in addition to export specialization, and that traditional variables of trade openness and FDI are not robust. This result is based on the econometric estimations that use not only cross-section and fixed-effect panel estimations but also system generalized method of moments estimations. The findings warn against the traditional emphasis on simple trade openness and FDI as policy prescriptions for developing countries. In other words, simply opening an economy for international integration does not guarantee sustained economic growth unless these actions lead to export growth, which requires capability building in indigenous firms and investments in innovations. This observation is consistent with the experiences of successful economies in Asia, such as Korea, Taiwan, and China.

AB Technological innovations are by no means Pareto-improving. I build on the argument that incumbent innovators can use political means to block rival innovations by emphasizing that the competitiveness of political system and some political institutions may diminish their ability to do so. I specify an institutional mechanism of agenda power, which provides newcomers with an improved ability to enter the game. The number of agenda power holders varies significantly among political systems, electoral systems, and administrative structures. With a sample of about 100 countries and across 20 years I show that politically competitive regimes, majoritarian electoral rules, and federal structures supply more holders of agenda power in comparison to their counterparts and, other things being equal, produce more innovations.

AB The development of clean energy technologies is a central issue in climate change negotiation. The signatory countries to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change agreed to organize the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network. The objectives of this paper are twofold. The first objective is to show a broad landscape of barriers in technology development. The paper summarizes the results of key case studies that were conducted to uncover technology-specific barriers in technology development. These case studies include both technologies for industrial use such as wind, bio-energy and building energy efficiency and technologies for individual use such as Light Emitting Diodes and photovoltaic panels. The case studies also contain technologies at the innovation stage such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle and Carbon Capture and Storage. The second objective of this paper is to highlight and define roles of international institutions in overcoming identified barriers in clean energy technology development. In this paper four areas of focus for international institutions are discussed, including: 1) increasing R&D cooperation at the innovation stage, 2) facilitation of intellectual property rights, 3) supporting finance, and 4) enhancing the enabling environment at the diffusion stage.

AB There are few marketing studies of social learning about new technologies in low-income countries. This paper examines how learning through opinion leaders and social networks influences demand for nontraditional cookstoves-a technology with important health and environmental consequences for developing country populations. We conduct marketing interventions in rural Bangladesh to assess how stove adoption decisions respond to (a) learning the adoption choices of locally identified "opinion leaders" and (b) learning about stove attributes and performance through social networks. We find that households generally draw negative inferences about stoves through social learning and that social learning is more important for stoves with less evident benefits. In an institutional environment where consumers are distrustful of new products and brands, consumers appear to rely on their networks more to learn about negative product attributes. Overall, our findings imply that external information and marketing campaigns can induce initial adoption and experiential learning about unfamiliar technologies, but sustained use ultimately requires that new technologies match local preferences.

AB This article highlights a pattern of military adaptation and tactical problem-solving utilized by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while engaged in protracted conflict with the Lebanese militant group Hizballah. It discusses the IDF's recent attempts to institutionalize their historically intuitive process of ad-hoc learning by developing a formal tactical-level mechanism for 'knowledge management'. The diffusion of this battlefield lesson-learning system that originated at lower-levels of the organization is examined, as well as its implementation and effectiveness during the 2006 Lebanon War. A nuanced analysis of IDF adaptation illustrates the dynamic interplay between both 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' processes of military innovation.

AB The electrification of the world's rural poor is an important aim of the United Nations. Off-grid technologies, such as electric mini-grids are seen as appropriate solutions. However, their diffusion rate in developing countries is not sufficient to reach poverty reduction targets. In this paper we analyze the case of remote electric mini-grids in Laos, a least-developed country characterized by many barriers to the diffusion of modern technology. We apply the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) approach in order to derive policy recommendations on how to increase the diffusion rate. As the TIS framework has hardly been applied to such challenging contexts, we also aim to produce insights for the theoretical advancement of the TIS literature. Our analysis, which draws from secondary and primary data collected through field work, points to two systemic root causes for the low diffusion rate: institutional mismatches within and across geographical levels as well as hampered flows of resources across these levels. Based on these findings we derive policy recommendations proposing to formulate a national technology-specific electrification strategy. In terms of insights for the TIS community, we suggest to strengthen the role of culture in empirical TIS analyses and to extend the definition of one specific TIS function. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper attempts to examine the strategies of national innovation system that shaped the science and technology cycles of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and China by theorizing the science and technology (proxied by papers and patents) trajectories of these economies using Meyer's taxonomy of bi-logistic growth. The findings suggest that the strategic catch-up models of South Korea and Taiwan have resulted in a much longer pulse in the growth trajectories during the transition towards knowledge-based economy than countries that are dependent on FDI for learning and acquiring technology during the early catch-up period such as China and Malaysia, while the results are mixed for Singapore. The catch-up strategy of supporting new start-ups for pioneering technology facilitated the development of capabilities of indigenous firms in the case of South Korea and Taiwan. This provides a policy lesson for transition from industrial-based to knowledge-driven development through the formation of evolving dynamic propagating behavior in science and technology.

AB African farmers have always been exposed to climatic and economic variability and have developed a range of coping strategies. Such strategies form part of flexible farm management, an ability that may prove very valuable in the face of future climate change and market dynamics. The generally low productivity of African smallholder farming systems is usually addressed by research and development institutions by a variety of solutions for improving farm performance. However, changes to the system may affect the flexibility of farms and thus their ability to cope with variability. We quantified the added value of being flexible and how this flexibility is affected by technical changes, such as composting and cattle fattening recurrently proposed and promoted by research and development institutions and projects. The study was conducted in two villages of the agro-pastoral area of Burkina Faso, where livestock, cereals and cotton are the main farming activities. A whole-farm simulation model was developed based on information gathered during focus group meetings with farmers and detailed individual monitoring of farmers' practices. The model simulates farmers' decision rules governing the management of the cropping and livestock farm components, as well as crop and livestock production and farm gross margin. Using the existing decision rules, current farm performance was simulated by assessing the cereal balance, the fodder balance and the whole farm gross margin. Then, by comparing the mean and the coefficient of variation of these indicators resulting from (a) the existing decision rules (baseline scenario) and (b) a set of less flexible rules (rigid scenario), the added value of flexible management was revealed. The adoption of composting practices allowed a slight increase in gross margin associated with a decrease in its between-year variability in comparison with conventional practices. Cattle fattening only led to a higher gross margin in the years with high rainfall and low input prices when no management practices were used to limit dependence on external input. This kind of technical change thus requires increased management agility by farmers to deal with climatic and economic variability. We conclude that assessing the impact of technical interventions not only in terms of productivity but also in terms of changes in flexibility is useful for a better understanding of potential adoption of technical changes.

AB The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network (DCVMN) held its fifteenth annual meeting from October 27-29, 2014, New Delhi, India. The DCVMN, together with the co-organizing institution Panacea Biotec, welcomed over 240 delegates representing high-profile governmental and nongovernmental global health organizations from 36 countries.
   Over the three-day meeting, attendees exchanged information about their efforts to achieve their shared goal of preventing death and disability from known and emerging infectious diseases.
   Special praise was extended to all stakeholders involved in the success of polio eradication in South East Asia and highlighted challenges in vaccine supply for measles-rubella immunization over the coming decades. Innovative vaccines and vaccine delivery technologies indicated creative solutions for achieving global immunization goals.
   Discussions were focused on three major themes including regulatory challenges for developing countries that may be overcome with better communication; global collaborations and partnerships for leveraging investments and enable uninterrupted supply of affordable and suitable vaccines; and leading innovation in vaccines difficult to develop, such as dengue, Chikungunya, typhoid-conjugated and EV71, and needle-free technologies that may speed up vaccine delivery. Moving further into the Decade of Vaccines, participants renewed their commitment to shared responsibility toward a world free of vaccine-preventable diseases. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Over the last decades, governments all over the world have tried to take advantage of information and communication technology (ICT) to improve government operations and communication with citizens. Adoption of e-government has increased in most countries, but at the same time, the rate of successful adoption and operation varies from country to country. This article outlines the evolution of ICT in the public sector over the past 25years. It presents general trends by examining interactions and mutual shaping processes between ICT evolution and several inter-related institutional changes including government operations, public services delivery, citizen participation, policy and decision making, and governance reform. The authors suggest that within a short time period, e-governance has evolved rapidly from rudimentary uses of ICTs as simple tools to support highly structured administrative work to the integration of ICT throughout government operations. The growing use of Web 2.0, social media, and mobile and wireless ICT by citizens can also heavily impact the way public services are delivered and how citizen engagement processes are carried out. However, new management approaches, governance structures, and policy frameworks are still missing, posing a challenge for governments to operate effectively in the age of big data. Generally, developing countries are lagging behind in e-government adoption compared with developed countries. Thus, for developing countries to successfully adopt ICT and try to leapfrog some of the obstacles encountered by early ICT adopters in developed countries, systematic analyses need to be conducted to understand the interactions among stakeholders and ICTs and co-create the institutional environment to lead to a positive impact of ICT on public administration. Only when this relationship is clearly understood can innovative ICTs be seamlessly integrated into the governance structure. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The inside-out and outside-in orientations place differing levels of emphasis on internal versus external resources and capabilities as sources of competitive advantage. While the inside-out orientation primarily considers organizational resources, followed by competitors and customers (implicitly), the outside-in orientation appears to reverse the order by first examining customers and competitors and then the degree to which the firm responds to them, implicitly addressing organizational resources. Existing empirical evidence does not clarify the comparative effects of inside-out and out-side in orientations on innovation performance. This paper draws on 232 independent studies (N = 38,051) analyzed systematically through a quantitative meta-analytic synthesis in order to develop a detailed contextualized elaboration of the relationships between the inside-out and outside-in orientations and innovation performance. Going beyond the direct effects, we also extend the literature by investigating the moderating effects of industry type (high-tech vs. low-tech), economic development (developed vs. developing countries), and cultural context (collectivist vs. individualist cultures). Our findings shed light on the relative value of inside-out and outside-in orientation for innovation performance, the direct and indirect effects of the two orientations on firm performance, and the conditions under which the effectiveness of each is enhanced.

AB This paper studies the interaction between international migration and intellectual property rights (IPR) in determining innovation performance of developing countries. Although emigration may directly cause brain drain, it generates a flow of knowledge acquired by emigrants abroad back to their home countries, which could be exploited under sound IPR institutions. IPRs can thus stimulate domestic innovation by creating the right environment to absorb potential gains from international migration. Using a panel dataset of emerging and developing countries, we show that emigration has a favorable effect on strengthening the link between IPR protection and innovation by making a new source of knowledge available to domestic innovators. We test our results through instrumental variable methods using information on geography, cultural distance and institutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Without good policies it will be difficult to provide guidance to research and innovation systems. However, policies need to be followed through and implemented to have the desired effect. We studied the policies and strategies in place to support research and innovation systems for health in Mozambique, Senegal, and Tanzania, and looked at the extent to which these policies and strategies have been implemented.
   Methods: We reviewed documents and reports and conducted in-depth interviews with 16 key informants representing various actors of the national research for health systems.
   Results: The results illustrate that there are various policies and strategies governing research and innovation for health in the three countries. However, implementation of these policies and strategies is generally rated as being poor. The reasons highlighted for this include lack of policy coherence, lack of enforcement and accountability mechanisms, and a lack of financing for implementing the policies. These contextual factors seem to be of such importance that even the increased stakeholder involvement and political leadership, as mentioned by the interviewees, cannot guarantee policy implementation.
   Conclusions: We conclude that due to the contextual realities of the study countries, there is need for greater focus on policy implementation than on developing additional policies. Government institutions should play a central role in all stages of the policy process, and should ensure implementation of defined policies. Strong mechanisms, including financing, that strengthen the position and role of government in policy coordination and the oversight of the policy process will help increase efficient and impactful implementation of research and innovation for health policies.

TI Potential electricity co-operatives in Kenya: could social capital be a
   barrier?
SO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY
AB Providing development inputs like electrical energy is a formidable task in many parts of the developing world. The generally rural nature of developing countries makes it necessary to devise innovative ways of getting electricity to the non-urban majority. It is also imperative that adequate and productive electrical power is made available, for sustainable development to be achieved by rural communities and by extension the national economies. Therefore, institutional and other innovations are being continuously mooted to meet the challenges; and it is in this context that rural electricity co-operatives have been introduced to developing countries. The co-operatives are promoted largely because of their social strengthening characteristics. However, questions arise as to whether social capital upon which the co-operatives are based is a facilitator or an impediment to the co-operatives, and the sustainable development that is ultimately targeted. It is argued in this paper that rather overstretched virtues of social capital mask undesirable elements of the capital. Importantly, organizations like co-operatives that depend on it can fail because of the neglected dark aspects. Empirical evidence from Kenya is used to support the contention. It is concluded that electricity cooperatives could remain a far-fetched possibility, unless desirable and undesirable characteristics of social capital are carefully taken into account.

ID GOVERNANCE
AB Innovation is increasingly recognised as an alternative for poverty alleviation in developing countries. However, cases of innovation in small producers' clusters in Vietnam imply negative externalities that conflict with today's notions of sustainable and inclusive development. This article analyses how small producers innovate while taking environmental and social considerations into account through an interactive societal process towards a community network, conceptualised as responsible innovation. Existing multifaceted theoretical insights do not provide sufficient basis to construct and test explanations. We apply a grounded theory involving Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to seek explanations as to why some small producers behave opportunistically while others acknowledge responsibility for the negative externalities. ANT enables us to see the critical details of the network creation process, including the agenda of the key actors, push and pull factors, the type of innovation, and the informal institutional context.

AB This special issue aims at advancing the debate about the interpretative power of evolutionary perspectives on economic development and institutional change. In the introduction, we argue that the interpretative power of the current evolutionary approach can be improved by elaborating an augmented' perspective to economic development, which explicitly integrates the role of institutions and the dynamics of natural resource sectors (e.g. agro-food) into the analysis. We maintain that such a theoretical and empirical advancement can help to define a conceptual framework that is more suitable to analyse innovation-driven change, differentiated development patterns, opportunities and constraints for developing countries in the globalised knowledge economy. A collection of papers that adopt this perspective are discussed in order to prove the interpretative power of this approach in a variety of development contexts.

TI The challenge of intermediary coordination in smallholder sugarcane

SO JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INSTITUTIONS
AB Orthodox approaches to development view the market as a key institution for driving economic transformation and for fostering innovation and competitiveness. The working of markets alone, however, does not always lead to improved outcomes such as increase in productivity or production efficiency in the context of smallholders. The role of non-market institutions, therefore, remains important. This paper examines the role of intermediary coordination in addressing constraints to efficiency and productivity of smallholder sugarcane producers in Tanzania. It also makes a contrastive analysis of a different organisational arrangement for smallholder sugarcane producers in Malawi. The key proposition is that while intermediary organisations of cane outgrowers in Tanzania have played a significant role in promoting effective market linkage, an increase in productivity required for competitiveness is limited by the lack of effective horizontal coordination.

AB The digital divide is usually conceptualized through goods-dominant logic, where bridging the divide entails providing digital goods to disadvantaged segments of the population. This is expected to enhance their digital capabilities and thus to have a positive influence on the digital outcomes (or services) experienced. In contrast, this study is anchored in an alternative service-dominant logic and posits that viewing the divide from a service perspective might be better suited to the context of developing countries, where there is a huge divide across societal segments in accessing basic services such as healthcare and education. This research views the prevailing differences in the level of services consumed by different population segments (service divide) as the key issue to be addressed by innovative digital tools in developing countries. The study posits that information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be leveraged to bridge the service divide to enhance the capabilities of service-disadvantaged segments of society. But such service delivery requires an innovative assembly of ICT as well as non-ICT resources. Building on concepts from service-dominant logic and service science, this paper aims to understand how such service innovation efforts can be orchestrated. Specifically, adopting a process view, two Indian enterprises that have developed sustainable telemedicine healthcare service delivery models for the rural population in India are examined. The study traces the configurations of three interactional resources-knowledge, technology, and institutions-through which value-creating user-centric objectives of increasing geographical access and reducing cost are achieved. The theoretical contributions are largely associated with unearthing and understanding how the three interactional resources were orchestrated for service-centric value creation in different combinative patterns as resource exploitation, resource combination, and value reinforcement. The analysis also reveals the three distinct stages of service innovation evolution (idea and launch, infancy and early growth, and late growth and expansion), with a distinct shift in the dominant resource for each stage. Through an inductive process, the study also identifies four key enablers for successfully implementing these ICT-enabled service innovations: obsessive customer empathy, belief in the transformational power of ICT, continuous recursive learning, and efficient network orchestration.

AB In organizations, knowledge creation activities are embedded in collaborative networks and are influenced by their partners. Therefore, we examine how entire networks change over time in this study, as well as the reasoning behind the structures of ego networks based on unique scientific research discoveries published in the emerging cross-disciplinary field of nano-energy. These data were extracted from Science Citation Index Expanded. Specifically, we mainly focus on two dimensions of ego network changes: network growth and diversity. Results demonstrate the recent remarkable growth of inter-organizational collaborative networks in the nano-energy field and empirically prove that the subsequent growth and diversity of ego networks are caused by three coexisting driving forces (collaborative capacity, network status position and cohesion) that act collectively. Our study is conducted at the organizational level because we investigate the universities, research institutes and firms that participate in nano-energy scientific research and the collaborative networks formed through co-authorships among these institutions in knowledge creation processes. Moreover, our study has significant implications for the scientific research conducted by organizations in developing countries and emerging fields.

AB The global sourcing of services from developing countries has made human capital a key local asset for attracting foreign direct investment. This paper analyses to what extent individual companies engage in linkages and collaborations with universities and how the education sector responds to the new demands of the knowledge economy. Offshore services are generally recognised as 'footloose' investments with limited local linkages. A case study of industry-academe linkages in the growing business process outsourcing sector in the Philippines finds that foreign investors engage in active embedding and develop linkages with human resource providers, leading to increased territorial embeddedness. This paper investigates the kind of linkages created, which actors engage in them and their motivations, to understand the resulting implications for local economic development. Interviews with foreign investors and higher education institutions reveal that most collaboration is initiated by large call centre companies and focuses on entry-level skills development for their operations. I argue that multinational corporations have been able to capture local institutions and introduce changes in the education system to supply mainly lower-end skills. While increasing the available talent pool and raising the competitiveness for further investments, this presents challenges for upgrading into higher value-added services and potentially transforms the country into a dependent market economy.

AB This paper examines the effects of urbanization on development and growth. It begins with a labor market perspective and emphasizes the importance of agglomeration economies, both static and dynamic. It then argues that more productive jobs in cities do not exist in a void and underscores the importance of job and firm dynamics. In turn, these dynamics are shaped by the broader characteristics of urban systems. A number of conclusions are drawn. First, agglomeration effects are quantitatively important and pervasive. Second, the productive advantage of large cities is constantly eroded and must be sustained by new job creation and innovation. Third, this process of creative destruction in cities, which is fundamental for aggregate growth, is determined in part by the characteristics of urban systems and broader institutional features. We highlight important differences between developing countries and more advanced economies. A major challenge for developing countries is to reinforce the role of their urban systems as drivers of economic growth.

AB While research has generated very useful insights, usually at the macro level, regarding the multifaceted nature of environmental innovation and regulation, the characteristics and drivers peculiar to international companies have remained underexposed in the policy-related literature on clean technology transfer and development. This article aims to help open the 'black box' of business, also as input for future policy making, by discussing aspects that influence corporate responses: sector-specific and company-specific peculiarities as well as those related to country contexts (both origin countries and host countries for companies). Most of the climate-related investments in 'developing' countries turn out to have been geared to a few emerging economies, generally involving established technologies with limited transfer, and a major role for developed-country utilities, particularly from Europe. Despite these limitations, there is a base with experience being built up, and a potential for extension to lesser-developed areas, but that requires market co-creation by joint business and governmental efforts. As viable business models are largely lacking, the article suggests three main modalities, ranging from fully commercial to primarily publicly funded, involving different types of actors and countries. Gearing policies more towards corporate realities and reaping the international momentum of sustainable energy might also further climate goals.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of innovation outputs proxied by number of patent applications, trademarks and industrial designs in developing countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs a panel data and Negative Binomial method to analyse the main determinants affecting the innovation outputs.
   Findings - The results implicitly suggest that providing a fertile ground to attract more foreign direct investment (FDI) can lead to much better innovation outputs. The study also strongly supports the role of institutions and governance for increasing innovation activities in developing economies as indicated by positive impacts of governance factors in the model. However, the impact of economic freedom indicators on improving innovation outputs is mixed.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways: it examines the effect of FDI and research and development on innovation of selected developing countries; and the study uses a panel data approach to increase the accuracy of the results through exploiting the significant variations of innovation outputs across countries, while controlling for a larger number of innovation outputs and product determinants. To the authors knowledge, this is the first empirical study on the behaviour of innovation outputs for developing countries.

TI Determinants of entrepreneurial intentions Technical-vocational

SO EDUCATION AND TRAINING
LA English
DT Article
DE Entrepreneurial intentions; Theory of planned behaviour;
   Technical-vocational education and training
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine factors that could explain the difference in entrepreneurial intention (EI) among technical-vocational education and training (TVET) program students. Centered on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the paper aims to contribute to the understanding of factors that affect EIs of students and offer some important insight into unique aspects of TVETs to empower youth and adults to actively engage in entrepreneurial initiatives.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey with a sample size of 107 TEVT students, taking part in four key programs, participated in this study using Entrepreneurial Intention Questionnaires. Linear and hierarchical regression were applied to test the hypotheses.
   Findings - The findings indicate that the two most predictable variables of EI were personal attitude toward behavior and perceived behavioral control. Hence, it was suggested that proper care should be taken in the way curricula and content are designed. It is also highlighted that the educational practice needs adjustment to include course contents like decision making, effective communication, entrepreneurial negotiation, leadership, effective and efficient use of sources, new product development, creativity and critical thinking, and service-based and technological innovation.
   Practical implications - Policy makers in developing countries are trying to address the critical developmental concerns of unemployment, rural-urban imbalance, industrialization, capital formation, and labor utilization. Vocational education is seen as a policy instrument to promote economic and social progress using entrepreneurship education. However, in order for institutions to play this key role, their skill formation process needs to be geared toward enhancing and developing traits associated with entrepreneurial success. This study has confirmed that TVET programs are required to reach a balanced spectrum of delivering entrepreneurial skills through intensive engagement with partners and effective mobilization of interest groups if they are to boost economic and social change.
   Originality/value - This study applies the TPB in an effort to understand determinants of EI on technical and vocational education. It invites academics and policy makers to rethink the approach adopted in entrepreneurship education in the vocational set up. It questions TVET programs' roles in preparing students for self-employment, networking or partnership efforts, and the design of curricula as a process and entrepreneurial skill as an outcome of entrepreneurial education.

TI Small farmers, standards, value chains, and structural change: panel
   evidence from Bulgaria
SO BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
LA English

   modernization
ID FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; DAIRY; SURVIVAL; GROWTH; POLICY; LABOR; EXIT
AB Purpose - In the past decade, there has been a dramatic decline in agricultural employment in Bulgaria and several reports have pointed at supply chain modernisation and poor milk quality as the main reasons for the dramatic decline in the number of farms. However, to date the policy debate is been based on ad hoc claims, while there is relatively little micro-level evidence. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the determinants of structural change in the Bulgarian dairy sector in the period 2003-2009.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses the determinants of structural change in the Bulgarian dairy sector in the period 2003-2009, using a unique panel survey of 296 farm households in the North and South Central Region of Bulgaria. In order to control for sample attrition bias, the authors use a two-step Heckman model of farm survival and growth model.
   Findings - The data confirms the rapid outflow of agricultural labour from dairy farming activities: 55 per cent of the farm households supplying milk to a dairy company in 2003 stopped supplying in 2009. The main reasons for quitting are ageing of the household, health problems and an increase in off-farm employment alternatives and not supply chain modernisation and milk quality standards. The institutional innovations which are associated with integration in modern supply chains, such as the provision of farm assistance programmes, have a positive impact on small farms' growth.
   Originality/value - The study is one of the first to use panel data to analyse the impact of standards on the survival and growth of small farms in value chains. The authors analyse the determinants of farm survival and growth in the Bulgarian dairy sector in the period 2003-2009, using panel surveys of 296 dairy farm households in the North and South Central Region of Bulgaria and panel data from interviews with dairy companies. The findings are relevant beyond the Bulgarian dairy sector as supply chain modernisation and changes in quality regulations are taken place in many other transition and developing countries.

AB The literature on Global Innovation Networks has contributed to identify changes in the innovation activities of multinational corporations. Although university-firm interactions are seen as an important factor for the emergence of GINs, their role has received limited attention. This paper aims to fill this gap in two ways. First, it carries out an exploratory analysis of an original survey dataset, of firms in three industrial sectors from nine developed and developing countries. Second, the paper analyses whether the role of universities in global innovation networks is related to national systems of innovation with varying degrees of maturity. Multiple correspondence analysis and a Probit model are used to establish the relevance of key factors in driving GINs. The results identify distinctive profiles constructed mainly according to firm characteristics, but reflecting country specific patterns of association. The Probit model confirms that internationalization processes and the existence of local interactions substantially increase the probability of interactions with international institutions.

TI Courts, Clans and Companies: Mobile Money and Dispute Resolution in
   Somaliland
SO STABILITY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID STATE
AB One of the world's most ambitious experiments in mobile money is underway in the Somali territories. In the absence of a strong central government and internationally recognized banking institutions, remittance companies and the telecoms industry have been innovating to provide services unique to the Somali context, which is making the economy increasingly 'cashless'. Mobile money has posed new regulatory and legal challenges, particularly when disputes involving consumers are involved. This article focuses on a case study from Somaliland (the northern, self-declared independent region of Somalia) and examines Zaad, the dominant mobile money platform. Given the weak state institutions, there are a variety of actors, including private companies, government police and courts, sharia courts and traditional elders that play an active role in resolving conflicts that result from mobile money transactions, forging a hybrid judicial approach. We examine how these different actors intervene and create an enabling environment to allow innovation and foster trust in a region of the world that is frequently characterized as violent and lawless.

AB Purpose - Building on recent advances in innovation research on developing country agriculture, this paper explores the concept of co-innovation, i.e. innovations that combine technological, organisational and institutional changes and that encompass different actors in and around the value chain. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a further conceptualisation of co-innovation and show its usefulness for analysing innovation initiatives in agrifood chains.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper combines two streams of literature (innovation systems and value chains) and is based on a review of the experiences with innovation in three different value chains in three African countries: potato in Ethiopia, pineapple in Benin and citrus in South Africa.
   Findings - Co-innovation is the combination of collaborative, complementary and coordinated innovation. "Collaborative" refers to the multi-actor character of the innovation process, where each actor brings in specific knowledge and resources. "Complementary" indicates the smart combination of technological, organisational and institutional innovation. "Coordinated" draws attention to the importance of chain-wide adjustments and changes to make innovation in one stage of the chain a success.
   Practical implications - The identified dimensions of co-innovation (the triple "co-") provide a practical guide for the design of effective interventions aimed at promoting innovation in African agrifood chains.
   Originality/value - The paper is the first to provide a comprehensive conceptualisation of co-innovation. On the basis of both theoretical arguments and evidence from three illustrative case studies it is argued that successful innovation in agrifood chains requires the innovation process to be collaborative, coordinated and complementary.

AB In the context of globalization, market liberalization, and deregulation, many African governments are embracing the potential of private agricultural investment to address structural issues within their agricultural economies. Sustainably integrating these investments into target landscapes, however, poses a number of governance challenges since it requires careful reconciliation of competing needs, priorities, and land uses. This paper examines the effectiveness of existing policy arrangements in managing these conflicts within two environmentally significant investment landscapes, the Oban-Korup Forest Block, Nigeria, and Lower Baro-Akobo River Basin, Ethiopia. Findings reveal that investments tend to conflict with socially and environmentally valuable land uses, largely as a result of institutional failings. The paper identifies a number of underlying institutional challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve sustainable development objectives within Africa's many emerging investment landscapes. Findings have relevance for the development of sustainable landscape governance systems and the alignment of global governance innovations with landscape-level policy arrangements.

AB Child labor is a common consequence of economic shocks in developing countries. We show that reducing vulnerability can affect child labor outcomes. We exploit the extension of a health and accident insurance scheme by a Pakistani microfinance institution that was set up as a randomized controlled trial and accompanied by household panel surveys. Together with increased coverage the microfinance institution offered assistance with claim procedures in treatment branches. We find lower incidence of child labor, hazardous occupations and child labor earnings caused by the innovation. Boys are more often engaged in child labor in our sample, but also seem to profit more from the insurance innovation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The 'Technological Innovation System' (TIS) framework and its system functions have become a popular analytical tool for the study of clean-tech innovation. There is increasing attention for the role of emerging economies in global clean-tech innovation, but the applicability of TIS to emerging economies cases is not entirely straightforward. A key issue is the limited geographical considerations, in particular transnational dimensions in TIS, whereas earlier perspectives on innovation in emerging economies have stressed the role of such transnational dimensions. This paper elaborates transnational TIS actor-networks and institutions, categorizes these in relation to TIS functions, and describes their potential to induce or block TIS development in emerging economies. We draw on insights from the perspectives of National Learning Systems, International Technology Transfer, and Global Production Networks for this purpose. We conclude that the potential effects of these transnational dimensions may be accurately grasped by the existing list of system functions, lending credence to its further application of the TIS framework on emerging economy case studies. Policy makers in emerging economies should recognize these transnational dimensions and seek to optimize their potential effect on domestic TIS development, taking in to consideration a realistic assessment of its role in the global TIS.

AB This paper introduces Rapid Appraisal of Agricultural Innovation Systems (RAAIS). RAAIS is a diagnostic tool that can guide the analysis of complex agricultural problems and innovation capacity of the agricultural system in which the complex agricultural problem is embedded. RAAIS focuses on the integrated analysis of different dimensions of problems (e.g. biophysical, technological, socio-cultural, economic, institutional and political), interactions across different levels (e.g. national, regional, local), and the constraints and interests of different stakeholder groups (farmers, government, researchers, etc.). Innovation capacity in the agricultural system is studied by analysing (1) constraints within the institutional, sectoral and technological subsystems of the agricultural system, and (2) the existence and performance of the agricultural innovation support system, FtAAIS combines multiple qualitative and quantitative methods, and insider (stakeholders) and outsider (researchers) analyses which allow for critical triangulation and validation of the gathered data. Such an analysis can provide specific entry points for innovations to address the complex agricultural problem under study, and generic entry points for innovation related to strengthening the innovation capacity of agricultural system and the functioning of the agricultural innovation support system. The application of RAAIS to analyse parasitic weed problems in the rice sector, conducted in Tanzania and Benin, demonstrates the potential of the diagnostic tool and provides recommendations for its further development and use.

AB National framework conditions directly affect the productivity of firms, but also moderate returns on their technological efforts. Although this has long been recognised, there is a dearth of quantitative analyses that openly consider this hypothesis. Using a data set of 15 425 manufacturing firms in 32 developing countries, we investigate the impact of national institutions on firms' total factor productivity with the help of multilevel modelling. The results indicate that technological infrastructure and educational system make a large difference, and also most significantly interact with firms' technological capabilities. However, governance measures that are conventionally considered in the literature explain surprisingly little.

AB Purpose - The economic impact of scientific research is receiving widespread attention all over the world, with interest being paid to research results that could potentially contribute to economic growth. There have been various policy responses in many African countries to facilitate the nation's transition from a production-based to an innovation-based economy, especially in the universities. The effort is, however taken for granted that scientists (researchers) are now having academic entrepreneurship mindset. The purpose of this paper is to attempt at developing a model that integrates individual, organisational and institutional determinants of academic entrepreneurship, which can facilitate the ability to cross the "valley of death".
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the theoretical and empirical literature to establish the factors that influence the capacity of academic researchers to discover and exploit opportunities for converting knowledge into commercialisable products.
   Findings - The findings indicate that exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities is driven by the extent of previous collaboration with industry, cognitive integration and prior entrepreneurial experience. Moreover, the university institutional environment must encourage and facilitate the creation of university spin-offs.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper and the proposed framework are based on theoretical suppositions related to the determinant factors underlying the formation of academic entrepreneurial intentions. Therefore, an empirical analysis is required to measure each factor proposed in this model.
   Practical implications - Considering the present weak national innovation system and university-industry linkages, universities in developing countries will require more than the production of potentially useful knowledge. There is need for conscious efforts by the university administration to put in place mechanisms that will facilitate the commercialisation of knowledge being produced in the university, encourage active participation in designing marketable products, as well as playing a leadership role in ensuring successful commercialisation.
   Social implications - The findings and framework developed in this paper can serve as an input to the design of policies that can stimulate the entrepreneurial activity of the academic researchers so that they can further contribute to technological development and economic growth in African countries.
   Originality/value - Majority of the empirical studies on entrepreneurship in developing countries have not attempted to understand the entrepreneurial intention of university academic (researchers). But the current efforts of integrating economic development as an additional function to research and teaching of the universities in developing countries requires that they should operate more entrepreneurially. Therefore, this paper is proposing a framework that might stimulate the creation and development of entrepreneurial university thereby making the university to effectively fulfil its teaching, research and entrepreneurial missions.

AB This paper explains the importance of IPRs and examines the factors hindering and those contributing toward enhancing IPRs in Sudan. We find that the inadequacy of IPRs protection in Sudan is attributed to low integration in the international institutions, lack of legal issues, lack of government concern, lack of private sector concern, weak institutions setting, lack of public awareness, lack of resources, a weak culture for IPRs, lack of cooperation between universities and industry and lack of coordination. The inadequate IPRs protection in Sudan leads to poor national system of innovation, hindering Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and hindering transfer of technology. The factors contributing toward enhancing IPRs in Sudan include promotion of adequate IPRs legislations and enforcement; planning, commitment to international IPRs agreements; finance, investment and resources; social partnership to encourage IPRs protection, increasing government concern, increasing private sector concern, improvement of public awareness, encouragement of cooperation between universities and industry, and improvement of institutions setting, coordination and culture for IPRs protection.

AB Surveys and interviews were used to understand community resilience in forest-dependent communities facing climate change in Cameroon. Surveys of 232 individuals showed a diversity of formal and informal institutions that relate to most aspects of rural life. Although direct activities related to climate change adaptation were limited, the activities and density of membership in rural local institutions could increase the community's adaptive capacity. Twenty-six semistructured interviews were also conducted with representatives of diverse local institutions who had some responsibility for agriculture, forests, conservation, or development. Local governmental institutions had not received any information from the national level and were limited in their knowledge of how to help communities respond to climate change. Although limited in their direct action on climate change, local nongovernmental organizations and international institutions act as bridging institutions with rural communities and could facilitate sharing of knowledge and innovation, thereby fostering resilience. Planning for climate change adaptation in Cameroon needs to build the capacity of diverse local institutions and improve the relationships between local and national-level adaptation planning.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate performance measurement practices in the Tanzanian Local Government Authorities (LGAs). It seeks to understand the performance measurement practices in the context of new public management (NPM) (Hood, 1991, 1995). Specifically, the paper focuses on the annual performance assessment (the local government development grant system), which operated in the Tanzanian LGAs as a base for accessing grants from the central government.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study executed a grounded theory strategy for data collection and analysis. Fieldwork was undertaken in three Tanzanian LGAs.
   Findings - The findings revealed how performance measurement practices were involved in the process of managing legitimacy, and consequently, in the acquisition of grants from the central government. Dialogue and learning about the performancemeasurement exercise and the production and manipulation of evidence were the two strategies employed by LGAs in the management of legitimacy.
   Practical implications - In practice, efficiency in organizations may be achieved through the appropriate design of systems, and by understanding, and addressing problems which emerge during their implementation. Learning is a significant strategy used by actors, and this needs to be taken into consideration by reformers when designing and implementing reforms.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to existing research by providing a framework for managing legitimacy. The framework supports and extends Oliver's (1991) typology of strategic responses to institutional processes and Suchman (1995) legitimation strategies. It identifies dialogue and learning as other forms of significant strategy in actors responses to institutional pressures. The study also provides additional evidence of the responses to the accounting changes and the NPM reforms.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the differences of relationship among perceived environmental turbulence, strategic orientations and new product success in export market by company size.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was conducted among 281 small and medium-sized and 222 large manufacturing exporters in mainland China. Research hypotheses were examined by structural equation modeling technique.
   Findings - The research results show that: market orientation (MO) and innovation orientation (IO) are not significantly different between large exporters and SMEs, while new product performance of SMEs is significantly less satisfactory; for large exporters, perceived environmental uncertainties in terms of technology and customer demands are critical driving factors of strategic orientations, while environmental dynamics in terms of technology and competition have significant impacts upon strategic orientations among SMEs; while MO plays a stronger effect in product innovation performance for large exporters, IO has equally important impact upon new product success across SMEs and large exporters.
   Originality/value - The authors extend the established theory about industry environment, strategic orientations and product innovation performance from companies in developed countries and domestic market to firms from developing countries who are operating in export markets. Furthermore, it is first kind of study that comparatively examines the relationship among environmental turbulence, strategic orientations and product innovation performance by company size.

TI Barriers constraining management innovation (MI) adoption in the
   Ghanaian construction consulting sector A case study
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

ID ORGANIZATION; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; STRATEGIES; DEMAND;
   FIRMS; MODEL; SMES
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to critically examine and report upon the barriers that constrain MI within the Ghanaian construction consulting sector. Globalization and the shift towards knowledge-based economies have encouraged organizations to adopt management innovation (MI) as a means of increasing market share and creating competitive leverage. Organizations within developing countries, such as Ghana, have followed this global trend, but barriers continue to affect MI adoption.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research is positioned within a mixed methods "deductive" methodological tradition and is undertaken via a three-stage iterative approach. First, the research synthesizes relevant literature to identify 14 potential barriers to MI adoption. Second, using convenient and snowball sampling techniques, structured survey questionnaires were distributed to 70 consulting firms within the Kumasi metropolis; a high 78.5 per cent response rate was returned. Third, data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component (factor) analysis to determine underlying barriers that restrict MI adoption.
   Findings - The barriers to MI adoption are contained within four inextricably linked factor groups: organizational structural influences, flow of information, institutional constraints and costs of innovations. The findings demonstrate that innovation thrives in an organizational environment that nurtures creativity, staff development, moderate risk taking and idea generation and management albeit, the external economic environment must also be conducive to facilitating innovation within companies and organizations.
   Practical implications - Innovation within construction companies is a prerequisite requirement for a dynamic and competitive economy because it nurtures self-regulating "free market" behavior, which creates considerable benefit to an economy. Such an attribute is particularly attractive for the developing country of Ghana, which has historically suffered from recurrent social, political and economic pressures. Hence, the research findings will be of practical interest to policymakers, academics and industrialists who have a vested interest in improving the performance of the Ghanaian economy. It will also be of interest to others within developing countries who are experiencing similar issues.
   Originality/value - This research work builds upon the work of previous scholars in this field and investigates the barriers to implementing MI in Ghana. The paper's findings will be useful to organizations and government policymakers who seek to increase business performance within a free market and profitability in an ever increasingly competitive world.

TI Assessment of knowledge economy A comparative study between Iran and
   Turkey and lessons for policy-making
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Iran; Assessment; Turkey; Indicators; Knowledge-based economy; Public
   policies
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe the current status of the knowledge-based economy (KBE) in Iran in comparison to Turkey, the challenges encountered and the appropriate policies toward Iran's Outlook 2025 based on which the country is expected to be ranked first in science and technology within the Middle East region.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study is a descriptive research. The methodology used for this study is qualitative/quantitative secondary research. The method will be used for two main goals. First, we used the World Bank's Knowledge Assessment Methodology, and the data are mostly collected from secondary sources such as the World Bank's Development Indicators for Iran and Turkey. Second, desktop research will be used to summarize and synthesize available studies on the consideration of policy-making toward KBE, especially among developing economies.
   Findings - The paper provides policy considerations around four pillars: information and communications technology (ICT), innovation system, education and human resources development and economic incentives and institutional regime. It suggests that regarding ICT indicators, Iran has to join international programs to attract senior public authorities' involvement and accountability. Regarding its innovation system, lessons for policymakers are implementing development plans and coordinating science and technology policies in the country. Moreover, the quality of education, in-company training, post-secondary technical education and scientific and technological workforce need to be improved. Finally, considering the weak macroeconomic circumstances, legislative measures are needed in addition to, establishing a promotion agency for foreign direct investment to coordinate the inflow and to grant incentives for attracting more investment.
   Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research approach, the research results have not been confirmed by an experts group. Therefore, using some group decision-making methods, such as panel of experts, could be proposed to further test the findings.
   Practical implications - The paper includes implications for public policymakers, especially in developing countries, and for moving toward a KBE.
   Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need to learn from similar countries experiences in policymaking about the same problem.

AB Purpose This paper aims to explore the perceived drivers behind the implementation of performance measurement systems (PMSs) in Indonesian local government (ILG). It analytically assesses Indonesias attempt to introduce PMSs by addressing three research questions: Do organisations in developing countries actually use PMSs to aid decision-making and help plan for future performance improvement? (RQ1) Do the three isomorphic pressures exist in the development and use of PMSs? (RQ2) and If institutional isomorphism is evident, can accountability exist within the development and use of PMSs given these pressures? (RQ3).
   Design/methodology/approach This research explores the perceived drivers behind the implementation of performance measurement systems (PMSs) in Indonesian local government (ILG). It analytically assesses Indonesias attempt to introduce a PMS by addressing three research questions: RQ1 Do organisations in developing countries actually use PMSs to aid decision-making and help plan for future performance improvement? RQ2 Do the three isomorphic pressures exist in the development and use of PMSs? and RQ3 If institutional isomorphism is evident, can accountability exist within the development and use of PMSs given these pressures.
   Findings Results determined that although employees perceived coercive isomorphism as being a driver of ILG compliance with President B.J. Habibies presidential instruction (Inpres No. 7/1999), the Laporan Akuntabilitas Kinerja Institusi Pemerintah/Performance Accountability Report of State Apparatus (known as LAKIP), many councils were still not reporting and those who were, were not doing it well. Many councils lacked management motivation, with some choosing to merely mimic (mimetic isomorphism) what others were doing. Better-resourced councils made use of external consultants or local universities where knowledge was shared (normative isomorphism).
   Practical implications An understanding of factors influencing the development and use of performance measures, in turn, can be used not only to improve PMSs in the future but to improve the quantity and quality of LAKIP reporting.
   Originality/value The theoretical development and interpretation of this research is drawn from institutional theory with a major contribution being that it provides an in-depth conceptual overview and understanding of factors influencing the development and use of performance measures. Further, it fills a gap in the literature exploring PMSs and accountability in a developing country in this case, Indonesia.

AB Potato is the third most important food crop in terms of global consumption, and it has been highly recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as a food security crop as the world faces a growing population and related problems with food supply. This paper presents data on global potato production, consumption, malnutrition, and hunger; information which helps pinpoint where the resource-poor and hungry live and how the potato and international agricultural research could help improve food security and livelihoods in developing countries. The International Potato Center has used such a targeting exercise to focus its research for development and develop its new strategic plan, in which five out of the six objectives are related to potato.

TI On optimal long-term relationship between TFP, institutions, and income
   inequality under embodied technical progress
SO STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS

AB We develop a simple optimal catch-up model under embodiment to study the potential long term dynamic relationship between total factor productivity (TFP), institutional quality, and income inequality in the context of a developing economy. Assuming a proactive role of institution in the persistence of TFP and minimum inequality spread for social optimum, we quantify the extent to which embodiment characteristics determine the long-term dynamics among these factors. It is shown that the amelioration (deterioration) of institutional quality influences skilled labour mobility across sectors (in developing economies) thereby decreasing (increasing) long term income inequality. Long run scenarios are built using our model in which the production sophistication of the economy under embodiment is shown to be compatible with both better institutions and less income inequality. Quantile regression results for a sample of 27 developing countries over 1990-2010 provide broad support to the theoretical predictions. In particular, it is found that - along the distribution path of embodied technical progress - there is heterogeneous response of productivity growth to the inequality spread and innovation intensity. Our results have interesting policy implications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As the largest solid waste (SW) generator in the world, China is facing serious pollution issues induced by increasing quantities of SW. The sustainability assessment of SW management is very important for designing relevant policy for further improving the overall efficiency of solid waste management (SWM). By focusing on industrial solid waste (ISW) and municipal solid waste (MSW), the paper investigated the sustainability performance of SWM by applying decoupling analysis, and further identified the main drivers of SW change in China by adopting Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model. The results indicate that China has made a great achievement in SWM which was specifically expressed as the increase of ISW utilized amount and harmless disposal ratio of MSW, decrease of industrial solid waste discharged (ISWD), and absolute decoupling of ISWD from economic growth as well. However, China has a long way to go to achieve the goal of sustainable management of SW. The weak decoupling, even expansive negative decoupling of ISW generation and MSW disposal suggests that China needs timely technology innovation and rational institutional arrangement to reduce SW intensity from the source and promote classification and recycling. The factors of investment efficiency and technology are the main determinants of the decrease in SW, inversely, economic growth has increased SW discharge. The effects of investment intensity showed a volatile trend over time but eventually decreased SW discharged. Moreover, the factors of population and industrial structure slightly increased SW.

AB The emerging field of the anthropology of Christianity appears suspended between two poles: a concern with understanding the continuous and relatively coherent traits of the religious tradition as a whole (the "One"), and the documentation of the highly contingent forms found in local communities (the "Many"). This tension, in turn, feeds sometimes intense debates about whether conversion to Christianity along the modern missionary frontier is best understood as rupture from or continuity with indigenous cultural forms and understandings. While such binaries have been highly productive, they are still misleading, because many if not most Christians do not experience the religion in such terms but rather largely in the context of institutionalized rituals, dogmas, and church organizations. I illustrate this point by examining the ways the Maisin people of Papua New Guinea have both adjusted and adapted to Anglicanism over the past century through three modes I describe as "accommodations," "repurposings," and "spandrels." Studying such institutional configurations, I suggest, provides anthropologists a strategic point to consider local versions of Christianity as both One and Many.

TI Citizen participation for sustainable transport: the case of "Living
   City" in Santiago, Chile (1997-2012)
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY

   Development
ID COMPLEXITY; ROAD
AB Twentieth century citizen "revolts" against urban highway projects have influenced thinking about public transport (Toronto, Vancouver, New York), governance (Portland), and cycling (The Netherlands) to this day. Less is known, however, about how these emerge in developing countries, and what they can tell us about citizens' role in innovation to achieve more sustainable transport systems. This case study examines a social movement that emerged in opposition to the country's first major highway concession, in Santiago, Chile (1997), challenging and changing urban planning paradigms. In 2000, the anti-highway campaign founded a citizen institution, Living City (Ciudad Viva). Twelve years later, it has become a prize-winning, citizen-led planning institution.
   Although the role of citizen participation in improving transport systems has become increasingly recognized in recent years, it still tends to be rather ritualistic. This experience offers insight into how strategic approaches to participation can reinforce the role of self-organizing civil society organizations in introducing innovation into existing systems. Findings suggest that traditional large movements, which are mainly useful for one-way communication of information, require support from small groups able to deliberate in a transformative sense, with more attention paid to how new consensuses can be transmitted through the relational networks of those involved. Moreover, this experience suggests that thinking about citizens as planners in their own right, rather than as mere participants at specific points in a planning process, opens the way to more effective strategies for innovating in transport, to address the social, environmental, and other challenges humanity faces today.

AB OBJECTIVES: The proportion of US medical students participating in global health has increased by 24%. These experiences are generally self-directed and lack a formal educational component. This article describes a structured, comprehensive, community-driven global surgery elective for senior-year students.
   DESIGN: "Surgery and Global Health" is a monthlong elective during which students shadow in the university hospital, lead discussions of an assigned text, attend lectures, and participate in a clinical rotation in rural Haiti. The first week is didactic and takes place in Atlanta, GA. Weeks 2 through 4 are clinical and are conducted in Haiti. Urological and general surgery procedures are performed during weeks 2 and 3, while the final week is reserved for follow-up care. This experience was institutionally supported.
   SETTING: Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, GA; L'HOpital St. Therese, Hinche, Centre, Haiti.
   PARTICIPANTS: Emory University School of Medicine students, years 2 through 4, supervised by faculty from the departments of Urology, General Surgery, and Anesthesiology. Senior-year students spent 21 days in central Haiti working in a rural clinical setting.
   RESULTS: Students participated in all facets of surgical care including preoperative clearance, postanesthesia care, discharge planning, and follow-up. Students felt a level of supervised responsibility that was not afforded at their home institution and were able to take on more advanced clinical roles.
   CONCLUSIONS: Students planned and executed this innovative experience with multidisciplinary, departmental, and institutional support. Stateside components introduced students to Haitian culture, global surgery ethics, and humanitarian surgical trip logistics. Structured global health experiences such as this give students practical skills and incentive to pursue careers involving global surgery. (C) 2014 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

DE Monetary policy; Bank lending; Structural panel VAR
AB This paper studies the transmission of monetary shocks to lending rates in a large sample of advanced, emerging, and low-income countries. Transmission is measured by the impulse response of bank lending rates to monetary policy shocks. Long-run restrictions are used to identify such shocks. Using a heterogeneous structural panel VAR approach, we find that there is wide variation in the response of bank lending rates to a monetary policy innovation across countries. Monetary policy shocks are more likely to affect bank lending rates in the theoretically expected direction in countries that have better institutional frameworks, more developed financial structures, and less concentrated banking systems. Low-income countries score poorly along all of these dimensions, and we find that such countries indeed exhibit much weaker transmission of monetary policy shocks to bank lending rates than do advanced and emerging economies.

AB This article investigates the transition dynamics related to Jatropha developments in Mozambique. The analysis focuses on how structural conditions (infrastructure, institutions, interaction and collaboration and capabilities and resources) enable or constrain interactions between niche-level Jatropha experiments and incumbent energy, agriculture and rural development regimes in Mozambique. Investors in agro-industrial Jatropha projects focused on establishing projects in areas with relatively good infrastructure, rather than in remote rural areas. Furthermore, they predominantly focused on Jatropha production instead of investing in the entire Jatropha value chain, which turned out to be a challenge in itself, as growing a productive Jatropha crop was much more complex than initially anticipated. The development of institutions that could nurture and protect Jatropha projects from the prevailing regimes lagged behind Jatropha project establishment, leading to an insecure investment climate. Strong inter-ministerial collaboration and organized civil society interaction and representation contrasted with non-organized private sector and rather isolated smallholder Jatropha projects. The global financial crisis and limited adaptive capacity reduced the time and space for experimentation and learning to overcome disappointing crop performance. Together, this hampered Jatropha's potential to challenge the energy, agricultural and rural development regimes. Nevertheless, the Jatropha experience did initiate the development of policy and regulation and stimulated interaction and collaboration between specific groups of stakeholders, which could provide the basis to capture future biofuel momentum in Mozambique.

AB Donors and Other development partners commonly introduce innovative practices and technologies to improve health in low and middle income countries. Yet many innovations that are effective in improving health and survival are slow to be translated into policy and implemented at scale. Understanding the factors influencing scale-up is important. We conducted a qualitative study involving 150 semi-structured interviews with government, development partners, civil society organisations and externally funded implementers, professional associations and academic institutions in 2012/13 to explore scale-up of innovative interventions targeting mothers and newborns in Ethiopia, the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and the six states of northeast Nigeria, which are settings with high burdens of maternal and neonatal mortality. Interviews were analysed using a common analytic framework developed for cross-country comparison and themes were coded using Nvivo. We found that programme implementers across the three settings require multiple steps to catalyse scale-up. Advocating for government to adopt and finance health innovations requires: designing scalable innovations; embedding scale-up in programme design and allocating time and resources; building implementer capacity to catalyse scale-up; adopting effective approaches to advocacy; presenting strong evidence to support government decision making; involving government in programme design; invoking policy champions and networks; strengthening harmonisation among external programmes; aligning innovations with health systems and priorities. Other steps include: supporting government to develop policies and programmes and strengthening health systems and staff; promoting community uptake by involving media, community leaders, mobilisation teams and role models. We conclude that scale-up has no magic bullet solution - implementers must embrace multiple activities, and require substantial support from donors and governments in doing so. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Emerging market firms (EMFs) are increasingly relying on innovation to find their competitive advantage, but our understanding of how institutional change affects firm innovation has been limited. We analyzed Korean manufacturing firms from 1994 to 2006 to test the proposition that market-oriented institutional change in an emerging economy alleviates firms' financing constraints and monitoring problems and improves the effectiveness of their innovation activities. Institutional evolution in the economy was found to affect Korean business groups and independent firms differently. Institutional change reduced the financing constraints on independent firms more than for business group affiliates in R&D investment. Independent firms, however, appeared less capable than group affiliates of translating the benefits of improved institutional environments into efficient R&D investment. This asymmetry may lead to a wider gap in the efficiency of R&D investment between business group affiliates and independent firms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB In the recent decades, the flows of trade, capital, and technology across the national borders of developing countries have increased, and have produced the conditions for a faster transmission of knowledge. While the economic literature has mainly focused on how international technology transfer may affect standard economic performances, less attention has been paid to a broader development perspective. This paper fills this gap by addressing two main issues. First, it investigates whether the technology transfer conveyed by international trade flows has positively influenced the development paths of less advanced economies. Second, it focuses on whether country-specific structural features may support the impulse of technology transfer on development. Our results show that technology accumulated in rich countries may help poor countries achieve higher development levels more rapidly, and that well functioning institutions may improve the capacity to transform the imported technology into domestic development opportunities.

AB A large and increasing proportion of agricultural growth in Africa must come from continuous gains in land productivity in areas of high population density and hence with already relatively high yields. What that requires is analogous to the green revolution in Asia. Several features differentiate the African situation. Those include greater diversity in cropping pattern including a historically larger and more widespread tropical commodity export sector. The physical infrastructure in rural Africa is far inferior to that of most Asian countries. While the greater diversity of agriculture calls for a larger and more diverse institutional structure the reality is that the research systems, the ancillary education systems to spread innovation and the rural financial systems are generally greatly inferior to those of Asia at the beginning of the green revolution. Ethiopia's record of a steady six to seven percent growth for agriculture and nearly halving of rural poverty demonstrates that with the right policies and investments a very poor country starting with poor physical and institutional infrastructure can bring a major contribution from agriculture growth to increased GDP and reduced poverty. As in Asia, the bulk of accelerated agricultural growth will come from small commercial farmers. They have sufficient farm income to reach or exceed the poverty level. Those are farms with, depending on the country, as little as 0.75 hectares to a few tens of hectares of land. They comprise up to half the rural population and produce on the order of 70-80 percent of agricultural output. They are in general not poor. The poor have inadequate land to reach the poverty level, initially with much underemployment, and with substantial non-farm employment. The primary driver of poverty reduction is the small commercial farmer spending on the order of half of increased income on nontradable, employment intensive goods and services from the rural non-farm sector.

   evaluation of personal and professional impact among global health
   volunteers at Addis Ababa University's Tikur Anbessa Specialized
   Hospital (Ethiopia)
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
LA English

AB Background: The positive impact of global health activities by volunteers from the United States in low-and middle-income countries has been recognized. Most existing global health partnerships evaluate what knowledge, ideas, and activities the US institution transferred to the low-or middle-income country. However, what this fails to capture are what kinds of change happen to US-based partners due to engagement in global health partnerships, both at the individual and institutional levels. "Reverse innovation" is the term that is used in global health literature to describe this type of impact. The objectives of this study were to identify what kinds of impact global partnerships have on health volunteers from developed countries, advance this emerging body of knowledge, and improve understanding of methods and indicators for assessing reverse innovation.
   Methods: The study population consisted of 80 US, Canada, and South Africa-based health care professionals who volunteered at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital in Ethiopia. Surveys were web-based and included multiple choice and open-ended questions to assess global health competencies. The data were analyzed using IBRM SPSS (R) version 21 for quantitative analysis; the open-ended responses were coded using constant comparative analysis to identify themes.
   Results: Of the 80 volunteers, 63 responded (79 percent response rate). Fifty-two percent of the respondents were male, and over 60 percent were 40 years of age and older. Eighty-three percent reported they accomplished their trip objectives, 95 percent would participate in future activities and 96 percent would recommend participation to other colleagues. Eighty-nine percent reported personal impact and 73 percent reported change on their professional development. Previous global health experience, multiple prior trips, and the desire for career advancement were associated with positive impact on professional development.
   Conclusion: Professionally and personally meaningful learning happens often during global health outreach. Understanding this impact has important policy, economic, and programmatic implications. With the aid of improved monitoring and evaluation frameworks, the simple act of attempting to measure "reverse innovation" may represent a shift in how global health partnerships are perceived, drawing attention to the two-way learning and benefits that occur and improving effectiveness in global health partnership spending.

ID INNOVATION SYSTEMS-APPROACH; INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE
AB Agricultural research designs tend to be bounded by agroecological conditions, farming systems and other dimensions assumed to be homogeneous for the population of interest (that is, a recommendation domain or population for whom a technology or practice is expected to be relevant). Scaling is then a question of 'rolling out' results across the domain. But what if technology adoption and institutional context explain the variance in the output of smallholders, and agricultural development is also a question of institutional innovation? What if a domain is seen as a system of interest among actors who have a stake in the system and as an arena for concerted action and institutional innovation? This paper reports on six years of action research that attempts to answer these questions. It compares experimental interventions and subsequent systemic changes within each of nine agroenterprise domains. The experience suggests that the research approach used can explain variance in smallholder output that, in present-day West Africa, is not explained by technology adoption.

AB Public research institutions and scientists are principal actors in the production and transfer of scientific knowledge, technologies and innovations for application in industry as well for social and economic development. Based on the relevance of science and technology actors, the aim of this study was to identify and explain factors in research governance that influence scientific knowledge production and to contribute to empirical discussions on the impact levels of different governance models and structures. These discussions appear limited and mixed in the literature, although still are ongoing. No previous study has examined the possible contribution of the scientific committee model of research governance to scientific performance at the individual level of the scientist. In this context, this study contributes to these discussions, firstly, by suggesting that scientific committee structures with significant research steering autonomy could contribute not only directly to scientific output but also indirectly through moderating effects on research practices. Secondly, it is argued that autonomous scientific committee structures tend to play a better steering role than do management-centric models and structures of research governance.

TI Comparative Multi-Criteria Assessment of Climate Policies and
   Sustainable Development Strategies in Cameroon: Towards a GIS
   Decision-Support Tool for the Design of an Optimal REDD plus Strategy
SO SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Article

AB Cameroon is committed to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plus conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+). To achieve this goal, the government has introduced a series of policy reforms and formulated a number of key strategic planning documents to advance the REDD+ readiness process in Cameroon. This paper assesses the extent to which major cross-sectoral policies support or impede the development and implementation of an optimal REDD+ strategy in Cameroon from a comparative multi-criteria perspective. Study results reveal that a majority of the policy instruments reviewed appeared to be less prescriptive in terms of any tangible REDD+ strategy, as they do not have provisions for tangible measures to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. Given the lack of adequate flexibility, prompt review and responsiveness of these cross-sectoral policies to adapt themselves to new realities and respond to a changing environment, this paper introduces a GIS-REDD+ decision support system (GIS-REDD+DSS) that is necessary to support the adaptive element of an adaptive REDD+ strategy in Cameroon. The GIS-REDD+DSS, an electronic REDD+agri intermediary hub, serves the following purpose: (1) host a database of locally-relevant climate information, improved input technologies, best practices as well as land use and forest cover geo-spatial maps; (2) host a virtual economic tool that performs economic valuations (costs and benefits) and financial analysis of REDD+agri projects to aid investment decision-making; and (3) host an electronic marketplace to mediate any-to-any transactions among REDD+agri project developers, service providers, input suppliers, private and institutional investors and buyers (wholesalers and retailers), thereby creating value in two ways: aggregation and matching. This decision support tool, we argue, is a fundamental prerequisite for policy and REDD+ safeguard integration innovation that allows new scientific findings to be integrated into REDD+ strategies in a short period of time.

AB Family therapists from 10 different countries (China, India, Israel including Palestinian citizens, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Spain, Turkey, Uganda, and the United Kingdom) describe systemic therapy in their contexts and current innovative work and challenges. They highlight the importance of family therapy continuing to cut across disciplines, the power of systems ideas in widely diverse settings and institutions (such as courts, HIV projects, working with people forced into exile), extensive new mental health initiatives (such as in Turkey and India), as well as the range of family therapy journals available (four alone in Spain). Many family therapy groups are collaborating across organizations (especially in Asia) and the article presents other ideas for connections such as a clearing house to inexpensively translate family therapy articles into other languages.

AB This paper addresses the role of tropical disease in rural demography and land use rights, using data from Onchocerciasis (river blindness) control in Burkina Faso. We combine a new survey of village elders with historical census data for 1975-2006 and geocoded maps of treatment under the regional Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP). The OCP ran from 1975 to 2002, first spraying rivers to stop transmission and then distributing medicine to help those already infected. Controlling for time and village fixed effects, we find that villages in treated areas acquired larger populations and also had more cropland transactions, fewer permits required for cropland transactions, and more regulation of common property pasture and forest These effects are robust to numerous controls and tests for heterogeneity across the sample, including time-varying region fixed effects. Descriptive statistics suggest that treated villages also acquired closer access to electricity and telephone service, markets, wells and primary schools, with no difference in several other variables. These results are consistent with both changes in productivity and effects of population size on public institutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reviews what has been learned from experiences of African agriculture and hence what policy lessons may be. Views of African agriculture over the last 130 years have changed from optimism to pessimism and at least halfway back again as the performance of the sector has fluctuated. Fortunately it seems the deep pessimism about agricultural prospects expressed in the 1980s and 1990s has receded. The performance of African agriculture since 1990 suggests that neither those who doubt that any significant advances are taking place, nor those who see advances in some remarkable but perhaps isolated cases of rapid transformation of farming and agricultural supply chains, have sufficient evidence - either from national data or small-scale studies - to support their positions. Hence policy has to rely largely on general principles and historic lessons, rather than more clearly proven propositions. Policy debates over African agricultural development may sharply divide on some topics, but there is little debate over the importance of basic conditions for agricultural development of an enabling investment climate and the provision of rural public goods. Beyond these basics, the challenge is to remedy the failings of markets that deny most smallholders access to inputs, financial services and insurance. Here opinion divides between whether to return to public provision, as with fertiliser subsidies, or whether private and collective institutional innovations will be sufficient. Recent initiatives to test and scale up the latter look promising, but most have yet to be evaluated. If agricultural development is first and foremost about establishing the basic conditions for growth, then most countries in Africa may be better placed than they have been in the past. Given the many examples that show African smallholders investing and innovating when they have the chance, then there are reasons to hope that the modest growth of production and productivity seen in the last two decades may accelerate in the future - thereby allowing African countries to make the transition from agrarian to urban economies.

AB In developing countries adaptation responses to climate and global change should be integrated with human development to generate no regrets, co-benefit strategies for the rural poor, but there are few examples of how to achieve this. The adaptation pathways approach provides a potentially useful decision-making framework because it aims to steer societies towards sustainable futures by accounting for complex systems, uncertainty and contested multi-stakeholder arenas, and by maintaining adaptation options. Using Nusa Tenggara Barat Province, Indonesia, as an example we consider whether generic justifications for adaptation pathways are tenable in the local context of climate and global change, rural poverty and development. Interviews and focus groups held with a cross-section of provincial leaders showed that the causes of community vulnerability are indeed highly complex and dynamic, influenced by 20 interacting drivers, of which climate variability and change are only two. Climate change interacts with population growth and ecosystem degradation to reduce land, water and food availability. Although poverty is resilient due to corruption, traditional institutions and fatalism, there is also considerable system flux due to decentralisation, modernisation and erosion of traditional culture. Together with several thresholds in drivers, potential shocks and paradoxes, these characteristics result in unpredictable system trajectories. Decision-making is also contested due to tensions around formal and informal leadership, corruption, community participation in planning and female empowerment. Based on this context we propose an adaptation pathways approach which can address the proximate and systemic causes of vulnerability and contested decision-making. Appropriate participatory processes and governance structures are suggested, including integrated livelihoods and multi-scale systems analysis, scenario planning, adaptive co-management and 'livelihood innovation niches'. We briefly discuss how this framing of adaptation pathways would differ from one in the developed context of neighbouring Australia, including the influence of the province's island geography on the heterogeneity of livelihoods and climate change, the pre-eminence and rapid change of social drivers, and the necessity to 'leap-frog' the Millennium Development Goals by mid-century to build adaptive capacity for imminent climate change impacts.

AB We conduct a framed lab-in-field experiment to explore the hypothesis that a number of stylized facts about microenterprise behaviour in developing countries - including product market homogeneity and lack of growth and innovation - can be explained by a social institution in which microentrepreneurs share the market to "buy a job." 280 present or prospective market trader women across four communities in rural Vietnam are anonymously randomized into pairs to play three "market game" treatments. The interactions are framed to simulate real-world retail market competition. The participants compete in an effort task, with performance determining market returns. A highly incentivized individual round allows us to extract a measure of individual "ability" in the effort task. The subjects then compete in successive treatments, where in the final treatment the losing participant in a round can elect to "burn" their competitor's output, which is framed as the application of social pressure. The behavioural responses are significant and fitting with a theoretical model of the social institution we have in mind: even though subjects are from the same community they are willing to punish ("apply social pressure"), the probability of punishment is increasing in the gap in ability in the pair, and this leads to a decrease in performance from higher-ability individuals. The study provides an example of the use of framed lab experiments to shed light on market behaviour in developing countries, for which full-blown RCTs may face serious feasibility or ethical challenges.

AB We analyze how the quality of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in developing countries impacts patent applications. We extend institutional economics to propose that firms vary in their interpretation of institutions, specifically arguing that foreign and domestic inventors respond to different institutional signals because of their different positions as institutional outsiders and insiders. Thus, we propose that foreign inventors, as institutional outsiders, respond more positively to the quality of IPR protection in countries with more democratic political systems, whereas domestic inventors, as institutional insiders, respond more positively to the quality of IPR protection in countries with higher quality legal systems.

AB Global disparities in the distribution, specialization, diversity, and competency of the health workforce are striking. Countries with fewer health professionals have poorer health outcomes compared with countries that have more. Despite major gains in health indicators, Rwanda still suffers from a severe shortage of health professionals.
   This article describes a partnership launched in 2005 by Rwanda's Ministry of Health with the U.S. nongovernmental organization Partners In Health and with Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. The partnership has expanded to include the Faculty of Medicine and the School of Public Health at the National University of Rwanda and other Harvard-affiliated academic medical centers. The partnership prioritizes local ownership and-with the ultimate goals of strengthening health service delivery and achieving health equity for poor and underserved populations-it has helped establish new or strengthen existing formal educational programs (conferring advanced degrees) and in-service training programs (fostering continuing professional development) targeting the local health workforce. Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital have also benefited from the partnership, expanding the opportunities for training and research in global health available to their faculty and trainees.
   The partnership has enabled Rwandan health professionals at partnership-supported district hospitals to acquire new competencies and deliver better health services to rural and underserved populations by leveraging resources, expertise, and growing interest in global health within the participating U.S. academic institutions. Best practices implemented during the partnership's first nine years can inform similar formal educational and in-service training programs in other low-income countries.

   BRAZIL
SO DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS
LA English
DT Article

AB The prevailing model for encouraging innovation based on patents and market-oriented raises at least two economic and ethical issues: it imposes barriers on individuals and developing countries governments' access to medicines by defining prices that do not match their income, and the unavailability of new or appropriate products to address the health problems of these populations. In the last decade, this scenario has undergone some changes due to the emergence of new actors, the contribution of aid resources, the introduction to the market of new products against neglected diseases, the development of new governmental healthcare policies and research programs, etc. One example of such initiatives is the Fixed-Dose Artesunate Combination Therapy (FACT) project consortium, which brought together institutions with different natures from both the North and the South, for the development of two antimalarial fixed-dose combinations recommended by the WHO - artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ). This paper proposes to describe and analyze the ASMQ consortium, which is the result of a new pharmaceutical development approach, based on a different paradigm - needs-driven instead of market-driven -, collaborative, with strategic participation of institutions from the South, funded by alternative resources (public and philanthropic). Thus, it represents an interesting object of study for bioethical debates on intellectual property and innovation, and its analysis is justified in light of the current debate on ways of stimulating needs-driven pharmaceutical innovation.

AB This study examines the effect of the post-1980s' structural adjustment reforms on the delivery and smallholders' use of veterinary services in two districts in Northern Ghana. Our analytical framework distinguishes between allocative, cognitive, and normative institutions to analyse the effects on four areas of service delivery: (1) prevention; (2) clinical services; (3) provision of drugs, vaccines, and other products; and (4) human health protection. The reforms were accompanied by substantial reductions in the allocation of both financial and human resources to public veterinary services; this in turn induced fragmentation in service supply, preferential service to progressive (or wealthy) farmers, and non-adherence to international protocols for livestock health reporting. A few communities self-organized to access veterinary services. Thus, the reforms triggered changes mostly in formal allocative institutions, but these triggered further changes in informal allocative, cognitive, and normative institutions that structured the impact of the reforms. The paper concludes that institutional change is not a one-off outcome of an intervention. Rather, such interventions trigger new dynamics that policy-makers and analysts need to take into account. This requires regular monitoring of anticipated and unanticipated effects of privatization and decentralization to enable policy adjustment.

AB This paper compares lessons learned from nine studies that explored institutional determinants of innovation towards sustainable intensification of West African agriculture. The studies investigated issues relating to crop, animal, and resources management in Benin, Ghana, and Mali. The constraints addressed were agronomic or economic (e.g. low production, yield, quality, prices) and institutional (e.g. poor access to resources and constraining regulations) and were analysed using an array of research approaches. The studies showed that political ambitions to foster institutional change were often high (restoring the Beninese cotton sector and protecting Ghanaian farmers against fluctuating cocoa prices) and that the institutional change achieved was often remarkable. However, flexibility of institutions, co-evolution of technical and institutional change, and increased transparency are needed to make institutional change successful. The programme Convergence of Sciences - Strengthening Agricultural Innovation Systems encouraged interventions where needed and enabled researchers and stakeholders to acquire the change capacities required to identify the need and potential for change and to make change happen. More research is needed to design pathways towards sustainable intensification based on social and technological innovation. Policy-makers should create space for institutional experimentation and empower smallholder farmers in West Africa to create resilient, local food systems to feed burgeoning urban populations.

AB Innovation is receiving increased attention among policymakers as a means of addressing sustainable economic development challenges. However, a range of factors such as inappropriate physical and knowledge infrastructures, incoherence of institutional frameworks, or lack of specific capabilities may have a negative impact on the functioning of the agricultural innovation system. The purpose of this paper is to apply a comprehensive innovation systems analytical framework, reconciling analyses of systemic structures, functions, failures and merits of innovation systems to assess and compare the performance of the agricultural innovation systems of Scotland and the Netherlands. To achieve this an analytical framework was drawn up based on the available literature, and through a process that included document analysis and a series of semi-structured interviews and workshops with experts in the two countries the agrifood sectors were empirically assessed. In both countries, systemic failures in terms of actors' interactions and competencies as well as market and incentive structures were revealed. However, differences emerge between the two countries that appear to relate more to social and cultural (soft institutions) differences rather than the formal legal and regulatory frameworks (hard institutions).

FX The analysis of the Dutch AIS is based on research undertaken within the
   collaborative research project 'Support of Learning and Innovation
   Networks for Sustainable Agriculture' (SOLINSA - FP7-KBBE-2010-4 266306)
   funded by the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission. The
   paper reflects the views of the authors that do not necessarily match
   the views by the EU commission. We would like to thank workshop
   participants and respondents for their input, and our fellow SOLINSA
   research partners for their support. The Scottish component of the study
   derives partly from SRUC Knowledge Transfer funding and partly from work
   commissioned by the Scottish Government as part of the 2011-16 Research
   Programme on Food Security and Resilient and Sustainable Supply Chains
   (Workpackage 5.1) and Adaptation to Change in Land Based and other Rural
   Industries (Workpackage 4.1). The input of Scottish workshop
   participants is much appreciated. Finally, we thank both reviewers for
   their constructive comment which helped to improve the paper.

DT Article
AB The current statistical picture of the world is probably the best it has ever been. But it also entails major limitations. In this article we show the limitations by focusing on three key areas: security, economy of development and the environment, and argue that they undermine the performance of global governance, and the possibility of global policy. In particular they do not allow taking the full measure and managing optimally the changes underway at the global level. To overcome this state of affairs, upgrading statistical capabilities is critical. To achieve this objective, the article suggests, among other ideas: adjusting and adapting the conceptualization, collection and implementation of statistical data to a world that is on its way to becoming global; improving the conditions of compilation of statistical data in developing countries; and investing in institution-building and innovation, in developed and developing countries, and in national and international organizations.

AB Background: Physician tracking systems are critical for health workforce planning as well as for activities to ensure quality health care - such as physician regulation, education, and emergency response. However, information on current systems for physician tracking in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. The objective of this study is to provide information on the current state of physician tracking systems in the region, highlighting emerging themes and innovative practices.
   Methods: This study included a review of the literature, an online search for physician licensing systems, and a document review of publicly available physician registration forms for sub-Saharan African countries. Primary data on physician tracking activities was collected as part of the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI) - through two rounds over two years of annual surveys to 13 medical schools in 12 sub-Saharan countries. Two innovations were identified during two MEPI school site visits in Uganda and Ghana.
   Results: Out of twelve countries, nine had existing frameworks for physician tracking through licensing requirements. Most countries collected basic demographic information: name, address, date of birth, nationality/citizenship, and training institution. Practice information was less frequently collected. The most frequently collected practice fields were specialty/ degree and current title/position. Location of employment and name and sector of current employer were less frequently collected. Many medical schools are taking steps to implement graduate tracking systems. We also highlight two innovative practices: mobile technology access to physician registries in Uganda and MDNet, a public-private partnership providing free mobile-to-mobile voice and text messages to all doctors registered with the Ghana Medical Association.
   Conclusion: While physician tracking systems vary widely between countries and a number of challenges remain, there appears to be increasing interest in developing these systems and many innovative developments in the area. Opportunities exist to expand these systems in a more coordinated manner that will ultimately lead to better workforce planning, implementation of the workforce, and better health.

AB Major challenges characterise the 21st century. These include providing enough food and healthy food for a growing global population, climate change, and the loss of soil fertility and biodiversity. The "knowledge-based bioeconomy", also referred to as a "bio-based economy", offers the opportunity both to make an important contribution to mastering these challenges and simultaneously to advance the transition from an economy mainly using fossil-based raw materials to an economy based on renewable resources and efficient in terms of raw materials.
   The concept of the bioeconomy takes natural cycles of materials as its point of orientation; it encompasses all sectors of the economy that produce, work and process, use, and trade with renewable resources, such as plants, animals, micro-organisms, and their derivatives. Materials used include not only raw materials produced in the agricultural, forestry and fisheries sectors, as well as in aquaculture or in microbial production; increasingly, biogenic waste materials and residual materials are also used. The bioeconomy is thus also resource-efficient recycling. The renewable resources are worked and processed to form a variety of products, also increasingly by means of industrial application of biotechnological and microbiological processes. Aside from its use for the production of materials, the use of sustainably-produced biomass also acts as a significant renewable source of energy - with preference given to using it at the end of the cascading process of use.
   Biotechnology, as a key technology, is an engine driving the international competitiveness of the German economy. It gives important impetus to the structural change towards an economy based on renewable resources. Use of biotechnological methods and processes can not only substitute oil-based products; it can also enable new types of product to be developed.
   The Policy Strategy - Bioeconomy builds upon the Federal Government's Sustainability Strategy. This dovetails with the "National Research Strategy Bioeconomy 2030 - our route towards a biobased economy", adopted in 2010, providing the foundation for innovations in the bioeconomy by means of research and development. The "Energy Concept for an Environmentally Sound, Reliable and Affordable Energy Supply" (2010), the "Raw Materials Strategy" (2010), the "German Resource Efficiency Programme" (2012), the "Biorefineries Roadmap" (2012), in addition to other strategies and concepts formulated by the Federal Government, describe further points of policy orientation and conclusions with a direct effect on the bioeconomy.
   The Policy Strategy - Bioeconomy sets priorities for advancing towards a knowledge-based bioeconomy and it highlights areas that require action. The aim is for the guidingprinciples, strategic approaches and measures to contribute to making use of the areas of potential for the bioeconomy in Germany, and also help to strengthen the structural transition to a biobased economy. The strategic approaches are to be further developed to match the long-term goals and to adapt to new challenges. The degree of success achieved by the strategy is to be examined in a Progress Report.
   Goals and guiding principles
   The structural transition towards a biobased economy can be successful only if combined with securing the supply of food and also with protecting the environment, the climate and biodiversity. These issues, together with taking social-responsibility aspects into account, are preconditions for a sustainable and internationally competitive bioeconomy. The goal of securing the availability of renewable resources and producing such resources must not be allowed to be attained at the expense of soil fertility, effective management of water resources, or climate protection. The bioeconomy is closely interlinked internationally. Decisions and developments in Germany can also have consequences in other parts of the world. Thus it must be ensured that the robustly-increasing demand for renewable resources also supports the development-policy objectives in developing countries and emerging economies.
   The bioeconomy affects various specific policy areas, such as industry and energy policy, the policy on agriculture, forestry and fisheries, climate policy and environmental policy, in addition to research and development policy. In aiming to give coherent structure to policy, the political framework conditions for the bioeconomy must be arranged so that, within the limits of what is possible, a contribution is made to securing world food supplies, reducing dependence on fossil-based raw materials, protecting the climate and using the renewable resources sustainably, while safeguarding both biodiversity and the functions performed by soil. In part, these requirements give rise to conflicts between goals, which need to be resolved by means of suitable framework conditions.
   For implementing the goals, the Policy Strategy - Bioeconomy is developing the following guiding principles, among others:
   Food security takes priority over the production of raw materials for industry and energy internationally.
   Paths of use with a higher value-adding potential must be given preference in the remainder of the work on structuring the bioeconomy's framework conditions.
   Where possible and purposeful, cascading use and coupled use of biomass should be applied.
   The aim to secure and strengthen the competitiveness of the bioeconomy in Germany and the areas of growth potential on the international markets should always be kept in sight.
   For the competitiveness of the bioeconomy it is imperative to have well-trained and well-informed specialist personnel.
   The opportunities and framework conditions for using key technologies and for effecting their transfer into commercial use need to be improved.
   The bioeconomy needs to satisfy increasingly challenging requirements from society in terms of the way in which goods are produced. This applies to the protection of the environment, the climate, nature and animals, and also to compliance with standards of social responsibility.
   The use of sustainability standards in the producer countries, especially in those with weak government leadership and weak institutions, must be expanded and appropriate efforts made to check compliance with them.
   In developing the bioeconomy there is a need for close cooperation between all those involved, from the political, economic, scientific, and environmental spheres and from society at large.
   Building upon the guiding principles, the Policy Strategy - Bioeconomy develops strategic approaches in three cross-sectoral areas of action and five thematic areas of action, supporting these with specific measures.

AB This paper studied the key strategies used by Datang, a local Chinese firm, to promote TD-SCDMA in order to explore an under-researched topic: how could a latecomer promote a technology standard? The findings suggest that Datang faced formidable challenges because of latecomer disadvantage and transitional institutions. The development of innovation capabilities and new technologies is needed but far from sufficient. It is necessary to develop special capabilities to get support from the government and public stakeholders such as scholars. The experience of Datang offers new insights into the development and adoption of technology standards sponsored by latecomers in developing countries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article examines a case study of the implementation of a performance management system in public sector housing in Fiji. The aim is to explore and provide interpretations of why performance management and measures were introduced and implemented and reveal if the indicators were appropriate to serve the strategies of the organisation. The article draws on diffusion of innovation theory and explores the effectiveness of performance management. The research approach is qualitative in nature and uses a case study strategy. Interviews and documentary evidence provide the empirical basis for the research. The organisation has established formal objectives at both institutional and departmental levels and has a performance management system at both levels. With growing pressure for commercialisation from donor agencies, the accounting and managerial practices seem to contradict the organisation's original purpose to provide housing needs for the poor. The case study extends the literature on performance management in developing countries and illuminates the deficiencies within the performance management system. This study has implications for practitioners and researchers as it promotes a better understanding of a new public management practice technique which, in this case, was inadequate to satisfy local housing needs.

TI Bribe Payments and Innovation in Developing Countries: Are Innovating
   Firms Disproportionately Affected?

AB Innovating firms pay more bribes than noninnovators across 25,000 firms in 57 countries. The difference is larger in countries with more bureaucratic regulation and weaker governance. Innovators that pay bribes do not receive better services and do not have greater propensity to engage in other illegal activities such as tax evasion. Thus, innovators are more likely to be victims of corruption than perpetrators. Our findings point to the challenges facing entrepreneurs in developing countries and are consistent with the view that rent seeking by government officials unlike private criminal activity is more likely to target innovators.

AB Finding ways to downscale microfinance is one of the current challenges facing commercial banks, especially in developing countries. As banks have a poor knowledge of microfinance, operating in this market will require capacity-building, innovative business models and new technological architectures. This paper discusses how one particular architecture - the Brazilian model of correspondent banking (CB) -is helping banks cope with these challenges. Since the model was created, in 2000, it has allowed banks to downscale financial services outside their traditional branches and establish successful partnerships with local microfinance institutions (MFIs). The authors focus on one particular case involving a partnership between an accredited MFI (Banco Palmas) and two major banks (Banco do Brasil e Caixa Econmica Federal), to make the argument that the Brazilian CB model represents an innovation at the "meso level", defined by Helms (2006) as the infrastructure comprising a network of service providers necessary to the operation of MFIs.
